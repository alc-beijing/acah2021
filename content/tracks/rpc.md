RPC (Remote Procedure Call) is used to solve the problem of cross-process and cross-host communication in distributed system. With the wide application of micro-service architecture in recent years, we have built solutions for micro-service Frameworks and solutions for development and service governance.

Apache Dubbo is currently the most widely used and most influential open source microservice development framework in China. In this forum, we will focus on the new features, ecosystem and practices of the Dubbo framework:

1. The latest progress of Dubbo3 in RPC protocol, cloud-native observability, Kubernetes, service Mesh, Native Image, etc.
2. The latest developments of microservice ecosystem, including distributed transaction solution, rate limiting and downgrading, service governance, etc.
3. Summary of microservice practical experience from typical enterprises such as Industrial and Commercial Bank of China and Zhengcai Cloud.

This forum would be very helpful for tech managers, architects, and developers engaged in enterprise-level microservice architecture.

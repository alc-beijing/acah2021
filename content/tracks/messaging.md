Messaging system is used to enable communication between systems by sending messages to each other.
It is used to decouple heavyweight processing, to buffer or batch work, and to smooth spiky workloads, also it can be used as the basic infrastructure for event driven and streaming systems.

In ASF, there are various projects that provide messaging services, for example:
[Apache Pulsar](https://pulsar.apache.org/), [Apache Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org/)
, [Apache RocketMQ](https://rocketmq.apache.org/), [Apache ActiveMQ](https://activemq.apache.org/), [Apache TubeMQ(incubating)](https://tubemq.apache.org/), etc.

In this topic, the messaging communities will share first-line experiences and best practices, exchange ideas and knowledge, and discuss the roadmap and the future of messaging technologies.

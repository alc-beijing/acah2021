Why an ApacheCon Performance Engineering Track? Because many Apache projects address domains with software performance and scalability challenges (E.g. Web, Cloud, Databases, Streaming Data, Big Data, Data Analytics, Search, Geospatial, etc), while others provide performance engineering tools (E.g. benchmarking, testing, monitoring, etc) that are widely used, so the track will provide opportunities for cross-fertilization between projects of different software categories and maturity.

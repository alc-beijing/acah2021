## Step 1: Create a presentation slides
Please use the PPT template provided by the conference organizers to create your presentation slides
Download the PPT template at
http://apachecon.com/acasia2021/Template_ApacheCon_Asia.pptx

* The Keynote session is expected to be a pre-recorded video for up to 30 minutes.
* The General session is expected to be a pre-recorded video for up to 40 minutes.


## Advice for writing slides
1. A good presentation should be clear, logical, focused and well thought out.
2. In the presentation slides, the text should be as concise as possible and accompanied by corresponding pictures, which should fit the theme and should not be fancy or colourful.
3. Use bold, italic, underline and large font size to highlight the key points you want to express and make it more intuitive for the viewer to understand what you mean.

## Step 2: Rehearse before recording
It is recommended that you carry out several rehearsals before the official recording, with the slides file for the presentation, to repeat the incoherent and un-fluent parts of it, and to revise the slides in time if there are any logical irregularities or mistakes.

## Step 3: Commissioning the equipment before the formal recording
1. The specific operations are as follows.
2. Check whether the recording software and recording equipment are started normally
3. Computer resolution 1920\*1080 in accordance with the aspect ratio Windows (16:9) or Mac (16:10)
4. Video encoding: H264 (mac uses QuickTime to record mov format) Video recording resolution, computer screen resolution, and exported video resolution after editing, all three ratios should be consistent, resolution 1920\*1080 Frame rate 30 (FPS) Bit rate 1500 or more (this is not strictly required, subject to the actual video)
5. Check desktop background, no other third party logo.
7. Please turn off extraneous windows and panel pop-ups (e.g. recording software toolbar, etc.)
Check the full-screen status, PPT and code editor, browser requires full-screen recording, browser should be displayed in full screen, zoom at least 125%
8. Adjust the code compiler and browser.
  * If you need to show the code when sharing, the code editor should be adjusted to a larger font size when recording, and the standard is 20-22 lines of code lines when the code editor is set to full screen. (The higher the resolution, the larger the corresponding font size, 1280\*720 corresponds to 24 characters, 1920\*1080 corresponds to 30 characters)
  *  When demonstrating the effect of code in the browser console, use "Ctrl" + "+" to make the console font size larger (in short, as long as it can be resized to enlarge, for mobile viewing).
9. Code folding: When the width of code or command statements exceeds the width of the editor and other interfaces, set the code to automatically fold to ensure that no scroll bars appear below the editor. For example, MySQL clients, linux commands, code writing, etc.
10. The IDE can only be used with a white or black background, with a contrasting colour scheme.
11. All active windows (e.g. PPT, IDE, emulator, browser, etc.) should be called up and opened at any time, and closed or minimised when you are finished, and either returned to the desktop after closing or minimising, or continue to open other windows in full screen (windows should not be stacked one on top of the other).


## Step 4: Official recording
As there are multiple speakers to deliver the speech in the same session, it is much easy to use [Zoom](https://www.zoom.us/) to record the session, as the speaker video could be appeared when the speaker is saying.

## Step 5: Pre-delivery check
1. Name the video in the following format: Name of sub-forum - Name of lecturer (e.g. Community & Culture - JiangBo)
2. Check the sound quality, there can be a current floor noise, but no obvious noise (e.g. flipping books, dragging chairs, car horns, birds chirping, etc.)
3. Check that the picture is 1920\*1080 pixels and that the ratio is windows16:9 or mac16:10.
4. The video frame rate is not less than 30fps (right click on the mouse and check "Details" in "Properties") and the picture must not be jagged or faint.

## Step 6: Video delivery
Once the self-test properties are met, please upload the video to a web drive and deliver the recorded file to Track Chair by sharing the link.

Track Chair will provide you with feedback on any problems with the video, so please correct them if necessary.

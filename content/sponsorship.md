Since 1998 – before the ASF’s incorporation – ApacheCon has been drawing participants at all levels to explore "Tomorrow’s Technology Today" across 350+ Apache projects and their diverse communities.

Apache conferences are the primary gathering of the collective Apache community worldwide; positioning your brand alongside the world’s largest Open Source foundation is one of the most effective ways to gain visibility and competitive advantage. Sponsors who showcase their products, people, and community support benefit by extending their brands to the greater Apache community, engaging with industry influencers, and connecting with potential future collaborators. Many sponsors consider Apache conference events to be invaluable resources for recruiting top Open Source talent.

Sponsors of past events include IBM, Comcast, Microsoft, Amazon, Google, Red Hat, HP, and dozens of other Fortune 500 companies.

But don't take our word for it, here's [some of our past sponsors](https://feathercast.apache.org/2016/05/09/why-did-you-sponsor-apachebigdata/), talking about why they sponsor ApacheCon.

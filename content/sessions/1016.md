The benefits of moving to cloud native architectures often shadow its costs in security, scalability, complexity, and monitoring.

As monoliths become microservices, direct client-to-APIs communication means exposing the APIs for each microservices. This means that the developers of the API need to add functionalities like authentication, rate limiting, traffic control and monitoring to each microservice.

Moreover, making changes to the API, like splitting or combining services, puts a burden on the consumers, requiring them to update their client applications.

An alternative is to adopt an API gateway to sit between you client and your microservices.

In this talk, Navendu walks through API development best practices and how API gateways simplifies API development. He uses Apache APISIX, the cloud native API gateway to walk through how API developers can ensure security, deliver scalability, improve monitoring and analytics, and simplify development while building APIs for the evolving cloud.

Traditional message queues such as RocketMQ are mainly for message asynchronous communication between microservice systems, but under the category of messages, there is also a very important and common message field, that is, IoT terminal messages. With the rise of smart homes and industrial interconnection, the news for IoT devices is exploding. Designing a message queue for both IoT device-class messages and microservices-oriented server-side messages would be of great value. If the data exists in only one system, the storage cost can be minimized, and the consistency problems and challenges caused by data synchronization between different systems can be effectively avoided.

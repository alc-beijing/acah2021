As CloudStack cannot work with any mysql clustering solution, it is time to explore a new locking service, manager and pluggable interface which would allow CloudStack DB to be HA enabled with multi-master read/write. Talk will focus on, - Need for a locking service and challenges with existing CloudStack architecture - Different possible clustering solution that can be adopted - Showcasing a PoC for future implementation with minimal changes to existing architecture using percona xtradb or any other clustering solution - Additionally, explore the idea of getting rid of mshost table, and use locking service to find about other management servers.

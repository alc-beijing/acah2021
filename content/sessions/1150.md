Bigtop is the Apache project for Infrastructure Engineers and Data Scientists who are looking for packaging, testing, and configuration of the open-source Big Data components. Its latest version 1.5.0 has been released as the Big Data Sw stack. From a real-world use case of Bigtop, the Wikimedia's Analytics/Data-Engineering team collaborated with the project to move its Cloudera CDH Hadoop distribution to Apache Bigtop. 
 In this session, the speakers will provide an overview of Bigtop's new features and their implementation details, plus a brief introduction of the work done between Wikimedia and Bigtop to support the migration of their data 
 infrastructure.

Reuse of common elements for geospatial information and processing results in increased productivity, lower interoperability friction, and higher data quality.  This presentation provides a survey of reusable geospatial building blocks. Common practices for coordinate reference systems (CRSs), spatial geometries and data arrays used for projects with geospatial content will be described based on open source projects and open standards.  Emphasis is placed on the use of open standards including the recently updated OGC CRS Well Known Text (CRS WKT) and OGC APIs. The presentation will provide the latest update on OGC API development.  OGC APIs are being defined for geospatial resources, e.g., maps, features, coverages.  Developed using OpenAPI, the APIS can be implemented in a number of languages and patterns. The presentation will be describe the state of implementations and plans for standardization.  The modular structure enables flexibility for developers to reuse OGC APIs in their APIs. This presentation will allow time for discussion of coordination across Apache projects with geospatial content.   Geospatial tracks at previous ApacheCons concluded with an open discussion leading to the creation of  geospatial@apache.org.

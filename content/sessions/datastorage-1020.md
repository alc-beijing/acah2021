Organizations need to manage resources allocated and used by different entities within it. In the context of Apache Ozone, resources are storage space and namespace (count of files, keys and directories). Apache Ozone provides capability to define, and control resource usages by specifying quota. Ozone provides ways to manage resources different from the hadoop system. The paper will present the resource management capabilities, behavior with respect to multiple ozone features such as trash, snapshot, and comparison differences with the hadoop system.

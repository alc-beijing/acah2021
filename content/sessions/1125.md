The Lambda architecture is a generic data processing framework in Big Data. In this talk we first give a brief introduction to the Big Data Lambda architecture. We then focus on how the three top projects of the Apache Foundation (Cassandra database, Spark data processing engine, and Pulsar stream data processing) can be effectively integrated to achieve a distributed, highly available, linearly scalable Lambda architecture. Finally we will demonstrate the implementation of this architecture with a sample IoT sensor application.

As one of the key open source rules, “community over code” has been accepted by most open source projects. Building an active community around a project is recognized as an important sign to measure a project is mature or not. Thus, many open source foundations have an explicit item on their checking list for project graduation from incubator status. However, different foundations (Apache, Linux, and OpenAtom) could have slightly different practices across projects. In this session, the speaker will share some lessons learned from over 10 years of open source contributions.

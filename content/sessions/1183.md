Data visualization is a challenging job to do in the Web-based environment due to the limited rendering efficiency of Web browsers. Rendering big data and providing user interaction in real time is even more challenging. nIn this speech, we are going to introduce how we made this possible with ECharts, a popular Web-based data visualization tool. Generally speaking, the solution lies in the following four aspects:n1. Simplifying shapes and rendering faster but with a similar result.n2. Optimizing code to improve rendering efficiency.n3. Applying stream rendering to give viewers a partial response as soon as possible.n4. Split data into several files and render in a pipeline to speed up rendering.

'We will talk about our open source work - YuniKorn scheduler project (Y for YARN, K for K8s, uni- for Unified) brings long-wanted features such as hierarchical queues, fairness between users/jobs/queues, preemption to Kubernetes; and it brings service scheduling enhancements to YARN. Any improvements to this scheduler can benefit both Kubernetes and YARN community. Abstract: YARN schedulers are optimized for high-throughput, multi-tenant batch workloads. It can scale up to 50k nodes per cluster, and schedule 20k containers per second; On the other side, Kubernetes schedulers are optimized for long-running services, but many features like hierarchical queues, fairness resource sharing, and preemption etc, are either missing or not mature enough at this point of time. However, underneath they are responsible for one same job: the decision maker for resource allocations. We see the need to run services on YARN as well as run jobs on Kubernetes. This motivates us to create a universal scheduler which can work for both YARN and Kubernetes, and configure in the same way. This YuniKorn scheduler (Y for YARN, K for K8s, uni- for Unified) brings long-wanted features such as hierarchical queues, fairness between users/jobs/queues, preemption to Kubernetes; and it brings service scheduling enhancements to YARN. Most importantly, it provides the opportunity to let YARN and Kubernetes share the same user experience on scheduling big data workloads. And any improvements to this scheduler can benefit both Kubernetes and YARN community. In this talk, weâ€™re going to talk about our efforts of design and implement the YuniKorn scheduler. We have integrated it with both YARN and Kubernetes. We will show demos and best practices.n'

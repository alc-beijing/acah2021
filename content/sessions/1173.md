Apache IoTDB (Internet of Things Database) is a database management system software for managing massive data in the Internet of Things. It integrates integrated data collection, storage, management and analysis functions. Temporal data in the Internet of Things scenario has the characteristics of fast generation, large volume and high potential value. According to the characteristics of sequential data, IoTDB uses an efficient compression scheme to help users reduce storage costs. Efficient read and write solutions are implemented to help users improve data service experience. Provides rich temporal data analysis capabilities to help users better mine value from data. Apache IoTDB is a lightweight architecture with high performance and rich functions. It is deeply integrated with Apache Hadoop, Spark, and Flink to meet the requirements of massive data storage, high-speed data reading, and complex data analysis in the industrial Internet of Things. Apache IoTDB adheres to the concept of "openness brings win-win" to do open source, incubated in 2018 and graduated in 2020 to become Apache international top database software project.

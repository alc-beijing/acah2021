I started off my life as a developer writing machine code and C and working on some low-level hardware projects. Then this thing called the internet come along and I moved into the web application space for a couple of decades. More recently I've moved back into commercial IoT development and not unexpectedly a lot has changed over that time. In this talk, I'll cover what it's like developing IoT projects. I'll go over the tools you need and the protocols you need to be familiar with. I'll look at how the C language has evolved to what it is today and how to write code that works well on memory constrained devices. I'll go over producing prototypes, rapid development, debugging and testing embedded applications and what and how much electronics you should learn. In short, everything you need to know in becoming an IoT developer and have fun doing it.

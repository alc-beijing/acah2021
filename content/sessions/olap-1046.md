Apache Arrow DataFusion is a fast, extensible, vectorized execution framework that uses Arrow as its in-memory data format, implemented in the Rust language.
DataFusion provides multiple levels of extension interfaces: users can easily integrate DataFusion into their database or query system implementations, taking advantage of its extreme performance and avoiding the problem of repeating the query engine implementation.

This presentation mainly includes:
1. What is DataFusion and its history
2. DataFusion's architecture
3. What extension capabilities does DataFusion provide (udf, logical plan, execution plan/node, etc.)
4. What scenarios does DataFusion use
5. DataFusion what use cases are currently available

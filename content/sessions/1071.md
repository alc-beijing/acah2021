Diversity and inclusion are becoming hot topics within our open source communities and industry, but for those of us 'playing life on easy', the subject and impact can be harder to 'get'. Like many people who used to play life on easy, I've had some blind spots around diversity and inclusion. I only discovered these through working on projects, communities and support at the ASF, and by moving to a new country! Now it is my mission to help others see the light, learn for themselves, and through that build better open source communities. I'll be sharing what I learnt, giving resources, and specific takeaway actions.

Apache Camel is the leading open source integration framework, which has been around for over a decade. In the last year and half, the Camel team has been working on the next generation v3. 
 

 The overall goal of this webinar is to show you what’s new in Camel 3, and how Camel is aimed for running modern cloud native workloads.
 

 Apache Camel is now a family of Camel projects:
 

 * Camel 3
 * Camel K
 * Camel Quarkus
 * Camel Kafka Connector
 * Camel Spring Boot
 * Camel Karaf
 

 Camel is the Swiss knife of integration, and the most powerful integration framework. In this session you will hear about the latest features in the new 3rd generation.
 

 Camel K is the serverless integration platform, enabling low-code/no-code capabilities, where integrations can be snapped together quickly using the powers from integration patterns and
 Camel’s extensive set of connectors.
 

 Using Knative, the fast runtime of Quarkus, and Camel K; then the trio brings awesome serverless features such as auto-scaling, scaling to zero, and event-based communication, and with great integration capabilities from Apache Camel.
 

 We will show quick demos of how Camel 3 and Camel k and present insights into what's coming next.

We analyze the data processing processes of several mainstream big data computing engines, identify some common problems, and use a unified solution to solve these optimization problems. The solution is OmniRuntime. OmniRuntime uses the JIT technology to dynamically generate high-performance operators. Enable vectorization execution with columnar memory data; Data can be exchanged efficiently. Reduce the network bandwidth between storage and computing by using the storage-computing collaboration technology.

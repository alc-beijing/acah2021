We analyze the data processing processes of several mainstream big data computing engines, identify some common problems, and use a unified solution to solve these optimization problems. The solution is OmniRuntime. OmniRuntime uses the JIT technology to dynamically generate high-performance operators. Enable vectorization execution with columnar memory data; Data can be exchanged efficiently. Reduce the network bandwidth between storage and computing by using the storage-computing collaboration technology.
 ### Speakers: 
 Jingfang Zhang: OpenLooKeng developer with 9 years of experience in big data development. Have been responsible for the design and development of massive storage active-active projects and deeply participated in the kernel design and development of the OpenLooKeng computing engine, involving the design and development of OmniRuntime. Cross Datacenter query technology exploration, and data transfer optimization work.

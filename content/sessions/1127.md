When Leaseweb acquired a new company 3000 public cloud customers we had to come up with a strategy to move all these VMs to our CloudStack setup. During this talk we will share: how we migrated a large foreign openvz environment into our kvm cloudstack environment in an automated fashion minimizing customer impact. The lessons we learned along the way and how we would do it again in the future.

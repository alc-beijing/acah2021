Alibaba has been using Apache Hadoop technology for big data analysis since 2009, and in 2010, it first implemented Apache HBase technology on a large scale in product search. In 2016, the nascent Apache Flink technology was used in real-time recommendation scenarios during Double 11, and in the same year, Alibaba Cloud released the E-MapReduce cloud product, which supports mainstream open-source big data technologies such as Apache Hadoop/Hive/Spark/Kafka. In recent years, the Alibaba Cloud open-source big data Flink team has become the main contributor to Apache Flink, driving it to become the de-facto standard for global stream computing. The team has also donated the Apache Celeborn and Apache Paimon open-source big data projects to the ASF. This topic will introduce how Alibaba Cloud's big data has gradually become a leader in the open-source community by embracing and contributing to open source.

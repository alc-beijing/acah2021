Come have a look under the covers at new data structures that enable geospatial and multi-dimensional indexing and search at massive scale in Apache Lucene. This talk will cover the indexing structures considered and ultimately implemented in the Apache Lucene Open Source Project along with the 25 - 30X boost in performance and centimeter spatial accuracy achieved in the latest release. Join us and see what's next for scalable Geospatial Search in Apache Lucene.

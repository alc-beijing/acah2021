In our global economy, businesses must be nimble and often have to adapt quickly. As a result, many businesses structure their teams in an Agile way to keep up with this demand. With Domain Driven Design, itâ€™s possible to quickly modify applications to accommodate changing business needs and easily integrate with disparate third-party systems. But what if you were able to use historical data and analytics to enhance your applications capabilities? You may not always have all the necessary information in your CRUD database. With Event Sourcing, you are able to store new application events as well as existing events resulting in more robust applications. This makes it possible to change your application in ways you have never imagined before! This talk will show you how you can design your Event Sourcing based application with Spring Boot and Apache Kafka.

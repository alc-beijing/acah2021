The Apache Way is a fully inclusive, open, transparent and consensus-based methodology, based on a neutral organisation that avoids project control by one party, where any individual contribution is respected and ensures the sustainability of the project. At the same time, the core principle of the Apache Way is 'community over code', which means that running a healthy project community is far more important than the code itself. Can this philosophy and methodology for running a successful open source community be applied within the enterprise? The speakers will take you into the culture and governance of open source in the enterprise and provide insights into how frontline engineers and technical management are embracing this new change.

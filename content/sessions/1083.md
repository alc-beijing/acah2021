Using Tomcat in a cluster and in a cloud. nWe start by looking how to configure tomcat to get a cluster andnthen explore the problems and solutions to have distributed applications running in a cloud. Most cloud providers now have a Kubernetes API.nWe will look to what we have to add to Tomcat to have a decent cloud supportnfor monitoring, tracing and operating on the cloud.nWe will show how to use all the pieces.nA demo of a cluster will be prepared and run during the presentation andnthe corresponding application will be moved to a Kubernetes cloud.

Apache Marvin is an open source project that focuses on empowering data science teams to deliver industrial-grade applications supported by a high-scale, low-latency, language agnostic, and standardized architecture platform created to simplify the process of exploration and modeling in Machine Learning projects. Marvin aims at abstracting the complexities in the creation process of scalable, highly available, interoperable and maintainable predictive software. In this presentation, the speaker is going to talk about the architecture behind the platform and show the cooler features of Apache Marvin.

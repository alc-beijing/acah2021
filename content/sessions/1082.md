Apache Pegasus(incubating) is a horizontally scalable, high-performance and strongly consistent distributed key-value storage system. In this talk, we will introduce the overall architecture, data model, use cases and advanced features of Pegasus. We will also take a deep look into some new features and performance optimizations working in progress and in future plan. Besides, we will present how Pegasus integrates with Hadoop ecosystem to gain wider use cases. Finally, we will focus on the current challenges the community is facing and how we plan to solve them.

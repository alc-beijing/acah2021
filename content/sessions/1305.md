In this talk we will discuss the infrastructure  Apache Beam has built to create a positive contributor experience. Over the last few years we have developed tooling, refactored code, instrumented Jenkins builds, collected metrics, created a metrics dashboard, and involved the community in order to ensure happy contributors. We will discuss the importance of engineering productivity and tooling in developing strong communities, where we have succeeded, and where we still have work to do.

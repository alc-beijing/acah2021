Does your organization have tons of applications and containers? Has this fleet grown to be completely unmanageable? Do undocumented changes cause downtime and pain for your operations? Using modern configuration management tools and practices (Chef and CI/CD), Mastercard created a set of cookbooks that builds, deploys and manages model driven middleware infrastructure. Join us for a talk where we will discuss what is and why you should do configuration management, how we chose to model the middleware configurations, examples of how to test the heck out of the whole assembly and how this methodology brings everything a step closer to “gitops”. This talk will dive into the guts of the cookbook and the processes around how teams onboard to the flow.

Apache Mynewt is an operating system for low powered embedded systems based on 32-bit microcontrollers. At the core, it is a small pre-emptive RTOS and an extensive set of modules for connectivity, file systems, power and performance management options and lots more. It is a highly flexible, responsive, general purpose OS for constrained devices, think of it as embedded Linux for devices that canâ€™t run Linux. Features include a secure bootloader, image management, hardware abstraction, instrumentation for stats and logs. This makes it easy to go from prototype to production when using Apache Mynewt without having to reinvent the wheel.

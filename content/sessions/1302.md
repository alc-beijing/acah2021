As a mature operational database with a 10+ year history as an Apache project, Cassandra has a long history with many twists and turns. In this talk, we’ll look at common misgivings and misunderstandings that we encounter in conversations with developers and get to the bottom of the story:

- Cassandra is a “columnar” (or “column-oriented”) database.
- Porting my relational data model to Cassandra will work well.
- Cassandra is a niche database that is only good for narrow set of use cases.
- My application can’t tolerate eventual consistency.
- Cassandra counters are unreliable.
- Never use materialized views or secondary indexes in production

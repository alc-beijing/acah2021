1. In this speech, we will discuss in depth how to use Apache StreamPark - a one-stop real-time computing job management platform,
Refined management of more than 300 Flink On Kubernetes real-time jobs. Apache StreamPark provides us with an intuitive visual interface to help us manage many key functions, including Flink job development, job deployment to Kubernetes, Flink Docker image management, Flink Kubernetes Pod Template management, etc.
2. We have also explored some innovative practices based on StreamPark: we have further combined with the scheduling system to realize offline data synchronization based on FlinkSQL, thereby optimizing the data processing process.
Through Apache StreamPark, we have realized the full lifecycle management of real-time jobs, greatly improving the efficiency of development and management. This process vividly demonstrates the powerful capabilities of real-time computing platform management and its great value in the actual production environment.

Bytedance is currently one of the companies with the largest coverage of data lakes in China, maintaining and running over 3,000 HUDI tables.
As the number of tasks increases, the cost of task management increases significantly, and HUDI's own table services such as compaction and clustering provide a fairly basic strategy.
In this context, Bytedance has implemented a data lake management optimization service for unified management and optimization of HUDI tables.

Apache Atlas has become the one of the rock star project for metadata management,where it can handle from data lineage to data tagging and terms. Apache Flink has also become the standard of streaming processing, while Apache Flink is powerful at processing data at scale, tracking the lineage became an problem for Apache Flink.
 

 In this session, I would like to share the recent community progress on connecting Apache Atlas and Apache Flink, and how the community can benefit from tracking the Apache Flink application's metadata.

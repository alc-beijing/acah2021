Apache Bigtop provides comprehensive packaging, testing, and configuration of the leading open source big data components including, but not limited to, Hadoop, HBase and Spark. While Hadoop ecosystem provides rich toolset for processing big data, there is no clear picture of compatibility between them. Bigtop makes introduction easy by providing combination of products working as a whole.
 

 We will introduce Bigtop 3.0.0, which is the first release based on Hadoop 3. Supported Linux distributions including Ubuntu, Debian, CentOS and Fedora are also updated. We will also talk about why it is hard to migrate compatibility issues and dependency conflicts between products, referring to on-going efforts in the ecosystem.

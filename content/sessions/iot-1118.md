Apache IoTDB is a timing database designed for Industrial iot scenarios that supports flexible stand-alone or distributed deployments on all sides of the end-to-end cloud. In industrial iot scenarios, end-to-end cloud data collaboration is a common application. This sharing will introduce the application of Apache IoTDB in end-to-end cloud data collaboration, and the main content is divided into the following five parts: 1. Explore the need for end-to-end cloud data synchronization through new energy and heavy manufacturing scenarios. 2. Analyze the advantages and pain points of existing end-to-end cloud data synchronization solutions. 3. Describe the evolution of IoTDB end-to-end cloud data synchronization solution. 4. Introduce the new end-to-end cloud data synchronization one-stop solution: IoTDB Pipe. 5. Show the idea of a data ecosystem based on IoTDB Pipe and show its infinite possibilities.

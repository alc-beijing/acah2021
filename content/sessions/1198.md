Let's Encrypt is a free, automated certificate authority (CA) which is open for use to anyone who owns a domain name.  Using Traffic Router as the DNS, we have integrated with Let's Encrypt when utilizing HTTPS on the delivery service domains.  Many open source projects provide libraries to ease implementation of Let's Encrypt, and for this project we used go-acme/lego (MIT licensed) to integrate with the Traffic Ops Golang API. Integration with Let's Encrypt provides many advantages including saving money by using a completely free CA, saving time with automation including certificate renewal, and improving reliability by eliminating manual intervention for certificate generation and deployment.

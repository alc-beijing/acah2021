This talk describes how a food tech company with 50k merchants was at a critical situation by delivering events to devices by using events polling on a Postgres database, and how it could solve this problem by moving the events repository to Apache Ignite using distributed, in-memory SQL. The change also allowed the company to be on the right track to support more than 500k simultaneous merchants.

The world's data and the speed with which we expect to access it continues to grow rapidly. Apache Cassandra was built for hybrid cloud implementations and that makes it easy for companies to fully exploit their cloud strategies without having to re-architect their applications or change their systems for data management. Sounds too good to be true? A lot of big companies have been doing it for years and you can too! In this presentation, we will cover best practices and strategies for deploying your app to Cassandra on any cloud that you want. We will discuss: * Uses cases that require the power of Cassandra for hybrid cloud * Data model considerations for your active anywhere applicatio * Deployment strategies on any cloud. We do not care which cloud :)

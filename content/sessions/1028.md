In this talk I will present a technique for deploying machine learning models to provide real-time predictions using Apache Pulsar Functions. In order to provide a prediction in real-time, the model usually receives a single data point from the caller, and is expected to provide an accurate prediction within a few milliseconds. 
 

 Throughout this talk, I will demonstrate the steps required to productionize a fully-trained ML that predicts the delivery time for a food delivery service based upon real-time traffic information, the customer;s location, and the restaurant that will be fulfilling the order.

Object storage is a technology that stores and manages data in an unstructured format. It is an ideal storage solution in the data lake scenario. As a cloud-native big data workflow scheduling platform, Apache DolphinScheduler connects and integrates with today's mainstream Cloud object Storage (Amazon S3, Google Cloud Storage, Aliyun OSS, etc.). This talk describes how to interconnect and integrate Apache DolphinScheduler with cloud object storage in the scenario of file storage in the resource center and remote storage of task logs.

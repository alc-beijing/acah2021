This session will walk through the internals of what the Go SDK does to execute a pipeline. Describing the structure of the SDK, where code is located, and the why of the structure, and how it does it with the particular features of the Go language, which notably has strict types but no generics.
Particular effort will be spent on what the Go SDK does for ease of use, and to reduce DoFn execution overhead.

Apache StreamPipes is an Industrial iot streaming data development toolbox for non-technical users to build message transfer between pipeline components based on various message queue systems. This talk will explore how to implement the message transport layer of Apache StreamPipes using Apache Pulsar so that Apahce StreamPipes can take advantage of Pulsar's advantages, including flexible scalability, high-performance message transport, low end to end latency, and more. At the same time, this talk will also introduce the practical case of this solution in the field of industrial Internet of things.

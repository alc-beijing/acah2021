Apache RocketMQ is a reliable, high-throughput, distributed message queuing service.
Tencent Cloud, as one of the leading cloud computing service providers in China, also provides Apache RocketMQ services on a large scale. At the same time, Tencent Cloud has also carried out a series of optimization and customization of Apache RocketMQ to better adapt to the complex business needs of public clouds.
In this process, Tencent Cloud has also accumulated a lot of experience and technology, including how to optimize the performance of Apache RocketMQ, how to improve its reliability, how to monitor and tune. These lessons are also of great reference value to other companies and developers,
I hope today's sharing has inspired you, thank you!

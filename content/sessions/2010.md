Open Source Community (OSC) can bring users and developers together organically through the Internet, allowing them to cross organizational boundaries and collaborate effectively for a common goal. In order for everyone to embrace an open and transparent open source culture with win-win cooperation and to nurture a healthy open source ecology, we need to actively integrate with successful open source communities in the industry to learn from their experiences and at the same time cultivate an organically developed open source community within the organization. In this sharing, Jiang Ning will combine his 15 years of open source experience to show you the exploration of this cultivation community.

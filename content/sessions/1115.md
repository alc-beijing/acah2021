Whatâ€™s it like to be a committed member of an active open source community? What are the awesome parts? What are the challenges? Is open source for you? In this talk, presenters with a wide range of experience at Apache will share their stories and advice on open source participation. From starting out to ongoing involvement, from participating in open source as part of your job, to finding time to participate outside of your job, from finding models and mentors in an online, asynchronous communication environment to being such a mentor, from the worst to the best moments and experiences in open source, join us to hear about more than 30 years of combined experience with Apache projects.

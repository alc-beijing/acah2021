This presentation will give you everything you always wanted to know about the Apache Software Foundation (ASF), but were afraid to ask. It will show you that there is more than just the Apache web server, and provide you with information on how the ASF works and its history. The difference between membership and committership, who decides what, how elections take place, the technical infrastructure, project management committees, and the philosophy behind the incubator. Come and see behind the scenes of the Apache Software Foundation and let's talk about 'The Apache Way' and 'Community over Code' which have been the cornerstones of the ASF for 20 years.

NetBeans has completed its transition to Apache and is now a top level Apache project with a strong and dedicated community and millions of users worldwide. NetBeans always had great support for Apache Maven & having an IDE of our own is a great chance to further promote Apache projects to a large audience. In this session I'll show you how to plugin your own language, tool, library, server, database or framework and make it easy for developers to get started with them. Use NetBeans as a marketing tool to shamelessly plug your own cool project.

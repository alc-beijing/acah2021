LocationTech is the geospatial software working group of the Eclipse  Foundation.  The projects range from fundamental libraries that provide  spatial operations to complex library suites which coordinate multiple Apache projects to build complete spatial processing solutions.nLocationTech GeoMesa builds on top of distributed Apache databases like  Accumulo, HBase, Cassandra and Kafka to provide indexing, querying, and  analysis for large spatio-temporal datasets. GeoMesa does this by  integrating other LocationTech projects like JTS, Spatial4J, and SFCurve with these databases as well as Apache open source file formats such as Avro, Arrow, Orc, and Parquet.nIn this talk, we will give an overview of the geospatial capabilities that the foundational LocationTech libraries can bring to a project.   With that background, we will discuss how GeoMesa integrates those  capabilities into distributed databases and the file formats.  We will wrap up with a quick look at the other big geo-data projects in LocationTech (GeoTrellis, GeoWave, and RasterFrames).

In this session, you will learn powerful Kafka concepts and techniques to upscale your skills in a fun way combining Kafka and Raspberry PI in a Led Strip game. Minimalist cars race with a Led strip and two switches where the speed of the car is proportional to the pulsations of the control button.
 What if you could play with the game to generate data and learn how to build a scoreboard and game statistics using Kafka.

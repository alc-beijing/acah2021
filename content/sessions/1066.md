Fine-grained data protection at a column level in data lake environments has become a mandatory requirement to demonstrate compliance with multiple local and international regulations across many industries today. ORC is a self-describing type-aware columnar file format designed for Hadoop workloads that provides optimized streaming reads, but with integrated support for finding required rows quickly. In this talk, we will outline the progress made in Apache community for adding fine-grained column level encryption natively into ORC format that will also provide capabilities to mask or redact data on write while protecting sensitive column metadata such as statistics to avoid information leakage. The column encryption capabilities will be fully compatible with Hadoop Key Management Server (KMS) and use the KMS to manage master keys providing the additional flexibility to use and manage keys per column centrally. An end to end scenario that demonstrates how this capability can be leveraged will be also demonstrated.

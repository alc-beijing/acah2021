In today's world, we don't have an offline first open source mobile banking solution. Nowadays It is too important to have an offline first application because in many rural areas, it is exceptionally hard to find an internet connection, sometimes taking days to get connected if a natural disaster happens Still, there are some areas where internet connection is still not even present and despite the many global efforts to bring connectivity forward, there are regions where there is still no timeline for connectivity. On the bright side, people can get access to an internet connection but they have to travel for that. Apache fineract-cn-mobile 2.0 is a native Android application built on the top of Apache Fineract-CN. Apache Fineract CN is an Application Framework for Digital Financial Services. It is a system to support nationwide financial transactions and to support the creation of an inclusive, interconnected digital economy for every nation in the world. Mobile devices are now in the palm of almost every hand worldwide, some high-speed internet connection and some with no internet or very slow internet connection in many places. I present Apache fineract-cn-mobile 2.0 that is the open source offline-first mobile banking application build on top of Apache Fineract-CN and maintained with Android Jetpack. Now we have eliminated as a barrier, no network or slow internet connection.  The codebase is very simple and easy to fix and debug. Typically as a project grows, so does its complexity, but with Android Jetpack and MVVP architecture, complexity remains nearly a constant  as when it was written in the first implementation. Fineract-cn-mobile 2.0 solves the topmost problem in financial institutions application development.n1. Maintainability and scalability with MVVM architecture and Android Jetpack (This give us the ability to adopt a new architecture that will come in future better than MVVM ).n2. Sustainability with ease of data synchronization.n3. Battery  Optimizatio 4. Offline first, No need for internet connection. WorkManager jobs take care of data sync to the server and from the server.n5. Easy learnable UI & UX.n6. Easy SQLite local database management with Roomn7. Logic abstraction with MVVP (Model View ViewModel)n8. Updating UI with LiveData I will be talking about the above problems that we solved with latest Android tech. I will guide developers on how they can pick up the codebase and can develop high-standard features according to his/her need and can manage customers entirely from Android device and How fineract-cn-mobile helps alleviate poverty and makes banking paperless.

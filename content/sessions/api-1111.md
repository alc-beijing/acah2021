- Background.
In the digital age, apis become the backbone of the enterprise. Many organizations are finding that applications built on top of apis are growing at a rate of more than 100% per year. However, exponential growth has created new challenges for many companies, especially in distributed organizations where API management has become quite complex. To address these challenges, many companies are using or planning to use API management platforms. These platforms are designed to provide fast, secure and automated API delivery without adding extra work to teams or causing system performance bottlenecks.

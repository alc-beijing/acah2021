Apache Beam is a big data processing framework that can run on multiple big data engines, including Apache Spark, Apache Flink, Apache Samza, Apache Apex, and a number of non-Apache OSS engines and proprietary engines. After situating Beam in the OSS ecosystem, I will share lessons from Apache Beam's journey, including topics such as:  - how do you onboard newcomers to the Apache Way?n - how is open source different / the same as internal corporate work?n - what are techniques for mitigating corporate politics in OSS governance?n - what does a healthy project look like in the stats?n - building community via pull requestn - how do OSS contributing teams look different?n - technical decisions have community impactn - how does ASF merit sustain projects for the long term?n - what seems to motivate volunteers?n - honoring non-code contributions

An Analytics Center Framework (ACF) is an environment that enables the confluence of resources for scientific investigation. It harmonizes data, tools and computational resources which subsequently enable the research community to focus on the investigation. The Earth science community is an innovative community. We produce many tools and solutions to improve how we do science. In computer science, a framework is a reusable, semi-complete application that can be specialized to produce custom applications [Johnson:88].  After more than two years of actively developing an open source ACF, on October 2017, the NASA AIST OceanWorks project established collaboration with the Apache Software Foundation, called the Apache Science Data Analytics Platform (SDAP). It is a big data analytics platform designed for cloud-based data management, analytics, match-up, and data discovery services. It is a community-support, extensible open source GIS platform. The motivation is to empower the Earth and Space Science Informatics community to develop a common big data solution for the cloud and on-premise cluster. The big data analytics platform is being used to support NASA Sea Level research, GRACE and GRACE Follow-On mission sciences, and NASA Physical Oceanography, etc. This talk describes the Apache SDAP and lesson learned from developing and moving SDAP in production to support various NASA and JPL researches.

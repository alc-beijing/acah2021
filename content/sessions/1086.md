In the last several years, there is more and more wide application of ARM architecture resources, not only in embedded or mobile devices, but also in backend servers. In common software area, there are also more and more voices that require to support ARM platform. Apache is the largest open source community. It has incubated many excellent and widely used open source projects, we have found there are customers who want to run the Apache projects like Hadoop, Spark, Kudu on ARM server, so it is meaningful for Apache projects to embrace ARM.
 Lately, we have done some efforts about making Apache projects support ARM platform, one important step is promoting ARM CI support for these projects. In this session, we will talk about the current status about ARM support in Apache projects, that mainly includes how we have built ARM CI on different CI infrastructures (Jenkins, Travis, Github action) and what common issues we have met during this process. We will also discuss the following works with other people.

Apache Unomi is a Customer Data Platform that is easy to extend as it uses the Apache Karaf runtime. In this session, you will discover how to integrate Unomi with Apache PredictionIO to be able to leverage artificial intelligence algorithms to recommend segments or products to users as they interact with websites. Of course, as all of this will be bleeding-edge stuff, expect plenty of last-minute drama, half-finished code and hopefully some fun demos.

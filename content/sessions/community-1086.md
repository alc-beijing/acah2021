This sharing will introduce the ecological relationship and ecological construction of dubo-Go open source community, which Li Zhixin is responsible for. This paper mainly analyzes open source community and organization, open source community and developers, open source community and users, open source community and technology ecology.
As an open source project of the Apache Software Foundation, Dubo-Go is developed, discussed and operated according to the specifications of the organization and enrichs the technical diversity of the entire organization. Similarly, Dubbo- Go, as a part of Dubbo ecology, has the reputation and users brought by Dubbo ecology. As an important part of multi-language ecology, Dubbo- Go plays a role of regal Java ecology in some directions. For open source technology projects, developers are the source of vitality and innovation of the project, and users are the embodiment of the value of the project. How to lead developers to build communities rhythmically and how to adapt technology with users are the problems that any open source project needs to face. For technical projects, upstream and downstream technologies are indispensable, specifically the compatibility and expansibility of the project architecture, which will also be introduced in combination with the project architecture.

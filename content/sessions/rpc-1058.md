With the popularity of cloud-native architectures, microservice architectures have become the mainstream application development model. In a microservice architecture, services are split into small, independent services that communicate over a network to complete business processing. In this architecture, the problem of distributed transactions is highlighted.
Distributed transactions face many challenges and problems, such as how to ensure data consistency between multiple services, how to ensure data consistency between database and table, and data consistency between heterogeneous databases. Without a good distributed transaction solution, these problems can bring many unexpected risks to the use of the application. A good set of distributed transaction solutions, which can help enterprises in the cloud native architecture to ensure data consistency, improve service quality and availability, reduce business risk and improve development iteration efficiency. This sharing will focus on the following aspects:
1. Data consistency challenges under microservice architecture
2. Architecture evolution of distributed transaction Seata
3. How to extend RPC framework based on Seata

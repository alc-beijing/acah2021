This session walks devs through Instaclustr's Cassandra tools and how they add key functionality and ease-of-use to their deployments.n- An LDAP authenticator plug-in for CassandranThe open source LDAP authenticator plug-in works closely with the existing CassandraAuthorizer implementation. The plug-in enables developers to quickly reap the benefits of secure LDAP authentication without the need to write their own solutions, and to transition to using the authenticator with zero downtime. - A Kerberos authenticator plug-in for CassandranThe open source Kerberos authenticator plug-in enables Cassandra users to leverage Kerberos’ industry-leading secure authentication and true single sign-on capabilities. The open source project also includes a Kerberos authenticator plugin for the Cassandra Java driver. - Cassandra Prometheus ExporternThe cassandra-exporter is a high-performance metrics collection agent that allows for easy integration with the Prometheus monitoring solution. It has been designed to collect detailed metrics on production-sized clusters with complex schemata with minimal performance impact while at the same time following Prometheus's best practices for exporting metrics. - Additional utilities and debugging toolsnIncluding a utility to assist with backup and restore to various cloud providers, and tools to provide debug-level information about SSTables. - A Cassandra operator for running and operating Cassandra within KubernetesnThe open source Cassandra operator functions as a Cassandra-as-a-Service on Kubernetes, fully handling deployment and operations duties so that developers don’t have to. It also offers a consistent environment and set of operations founded on best practices, which is reproducible across production clusters and development, staging, and QA environments. The audience for this presentation will learn the specifics of how to implement – and get the most out of – these open source solutions.

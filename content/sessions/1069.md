Time series data is the main data in IIoT. In the analysis and utiliization of time series data, data quality is vital. Low-quality data may cause problems in our analysis and even mislead our decisions.
As a top-level open source project of Apache, Apache IoTDB, the data management system for time series data, can provide users specific services, including storage and analysis. Based on its User Defined Functions (UDF), IoTDB-Quality achieves a series of functions about data quality, including data profiling, data quality evalution and data repairing, which significantly enhances IoTDB and effectively meets the demand for data quality in the industrial field.

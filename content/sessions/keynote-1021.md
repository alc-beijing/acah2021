For those of us who already know how important open source is, it canbe challenging to persuasively make the case to management, because weassume that everyone already knows the basics. This can work againstus, confusing our audience and making us come across as condescendingor concerned about irrelevant lofty philosophical points.In this talk, we take it back to the basics. What does managementactually need to know about open source, why it matters, and how tomake decisions about consuming open source, contributing to opensource, and open sourcing company code?

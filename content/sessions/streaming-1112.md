Digital DAG Framework is a flink-based real-time computing framework built by JD retail data and intelligence based on JD's business characteristics to improve the development efficiency of r&d personnel in specific scenarios. It is committed to building unique flink-based data flow scenarios, including but not limited to:
1) Machine learning scenario: Dedicated to the construction of a unique machine learning workflow based on Flink, internal machine learning link closed loop, including but not limited to real-time feature generation, sample splicing, feature engineering, model training, model estimation and other links, full link batch integration, multiplexing operator.
2) List scenario: committed to solving multi-stream Join scenario and TopN scenario
3) Query moving line analysis scenario: Flink Gelly is used to drop the data of graph analysis results into OLAP for multidimensional analysis, and then start streaming analysis to Query OLAP for data analysts to provide AB causality analysis for QP scenario


And other technical points, mainly share some machine learning engineering and related data analysis technology scenarios and corresponding solutions accumulated by jd Retail Data and Intelligence Department

Now I am in charge of real-time computing business of data analysis and optimization Department. And hope to precipitate a set of complete and efficient enabling business framework on this basis


As a contributor for many open source projects such as Alink and DL on Flink, I have made speeches at Flink Forward Asia 2021 and InfoQ QCon+ Case Study Society Global Software Conference

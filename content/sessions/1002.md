This talk will focus on how any organization can deploy a Content Delivery Network (CDN) to cache web object at scale using Apache Traffic Control (ATC) and Apache Traffic Server (ATS). Topics covered will be a brief introduction to the projects, a high-level overview of traffic routing on a CDN, followed by a deep dive into how to efficiently cache objects on an ATC CDN using ATS. Based on years of experience operating ATC CDNs, several different scenarios with corresponding object types (video, web content, etc) will be presented. Learn how the ATC configuration relates to ATS, how different storage mediums can be employed to cache different objects types, how to select the correct redundancy strategies, and how a caching hierarchy can be employed to increase cache efficiency.

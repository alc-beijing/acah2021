The API gateway is the synchronized and unified management of the API interface service capabilities provided by all microservices. The gateway can then implement general requirements for API interfaces such as Load Balancing, Dynamic Upstream, Canary Release, Circuit Breaking, Authentication, Observability, etc. As a technology product born with cloud-native features, it is closely related to API interfaces but a little different. By analyzing these two concepts, we may be able to foresee the future API development trend.

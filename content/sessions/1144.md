Federated authentication in online services is increasingly being used, whether through public identity providers such as Facebook, Google and others, or in organizations' private identity providers. Identity federation is a technology that has come to simplify the life of the user, but that does not always simplify the life of application developers and operators. The purpose of this talk is to share a bit the challenges, benefits and problems of using federated authentication with multiple identity providers in Apache Cloudstack.

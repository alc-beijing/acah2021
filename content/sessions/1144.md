The open source community is gradually becoming one of the most critical path in the software ecosystem. In the evaluating process of open source comunity, data-driven insight and analysis of the current state of the community is very meaningful for helping community grow healthy. Therefore, the data-driven operations plays a key role in community.
 

 In this topic, we will introduce our best practices for data-driven community operations. This openrations management system helps several of the most active open source communities in China (such as openEuler, openGauss, MindSpore, etc.) to efficiently and scientifically measure the health, activity and other key metrics of the community.
 

 This topic includes:
 1. Why we need a data-driven operations system? It introduces the operations problem the community faced and also introduces the benefits of it for the open source community growthing.
 

 2. The overview of the data-driven operations design. Introduced our thinking and practice in the process of technology selection, metrics data visualization and big data analysis。
 

 3. With the real case of openEuler community, it talks about how data-driven operations system is implemented, how the powerful Apache bigdata project are used to build the first available version (including data storage, ananlysis, data insight and visualization). Finally, and introduced how we contribute our improvements to the upstream Apache projects.
 ### Speakers: 
 Jun Zhong: Participated in the open source community for more than 6 years. Currently, she is responsible for the digital operation system of the openEuler, MindSpore, openGauss, and openLookeng projects. Served as a core contributor to multiple communities, such as the maintainer of the infra sig team of the openEuler open source community, the maintainer of the infra sig team of the openGauss open source community, and the core member of the OpenStack manila project.

Yikun Jiang: Yikun Jiang, is senior software engineer from Huawei opensource development team, participated in the open source community for more than 5 years, working on multi-arch support and improvement of projects in bigdata area. He has five years experience in cloud computing and bigdata optimization. Previously, he was the core member of OpenStack storage project.

Lei Peng: Lei Peng is senior software engineer from Huawei opensource development team, working on multi-arch support and improvement of MySQL. He has five years experience in SQL develop and bigdata use. Previously, he researched the MySQL kernel, including MySQL Group Replication and worked on kernel development of distributed databases. He has two years experience in using bigdata project such as Spark/Kafka/Hadoop.

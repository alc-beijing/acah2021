Security data is often challenging to analyze because it comes in a variety of formats that are difficult and time consuming to parse, requiring a myriad of various tools to analyze this data. Additionally, bringing this data together to correlate multiple data sets can be difficult and extremely time consuming. But what if all your data could be queried with single tool, using a common language? This talk will demonstrate how to use Apache Drill's enormous analytic power on security data sets and visualize this data using Apache Superset.

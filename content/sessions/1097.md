An experienced CloudStack developer will show his journey to deploy an OpenStack cloud. We will compare the pros and cons of CloudStack and OpenStack from the following perspectives:n(i) Deployment: cost, time and risks of deploying a CloudStack vs OpenStack infrastructure;n(ii) Maintenance: the costs and time required on maintaining a Cloud orchestrated with CloudStack and another with OpenStack; and,n(ii) Development: how development on both orchestrators is done? What looks like the codebase of each project and which technologies are involved? What kind of professional/development team is required?

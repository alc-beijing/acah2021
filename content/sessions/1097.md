InnerSource is adopting the apache way inside one organization. when I practice InnerSource together with DevOps, I found that to make DevOps Practice successful, the same core value such as Open, transparent, Collaboration are also very important. They are the apache way that works for the open source community, but also works for DevOps.
 

 In my talk, I will describe what I found and explain why.

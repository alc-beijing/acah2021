The open source community is gradually becoming one of the most critical path in the software ecosystem. In the evaluating process of open source comunity, data-driven insight and analysis of the current state of the community is very meaningful for helping community grow healthy. Therefore, the data-driven operations plays a key role in community.
 

 In this topic, we will introduce our best practices for data-driven community operations. This openrations management system helps several of the most active open source communities in China (such as openEuler, openGauss, MindSpore, etc.) to efficiently and scientifically measure the health, activity and other key metrics of the community.
 

 This topic includes:
 1. Why we need a data-driven operations system? It introduces the operations problem the community faced and also introduces the benefits of it for the open source community growthing.
 

 2. The overview of the data-driven operations design. Introduced our thinking and practice in the process of technology selection, metrics data visualization and big data analysis。
 

 3. With the real case of openEuler community, it talks about how data-driven operations system is implemented, how the powerful Apache bigdata project are used to build the first available version (including data storage, ananlysis, data insight and visualization). Finally, and introduced how we contribute our improvements to the upstream Apache projects.

Brpc is the most commonly used industrial-grade RPC framework in Baidu, with high performance, ease of use, and convenience to locate problems. Therefore, hundreds of services in Baidu have used Brpc. Brpc was developed early, and its performance has been able to meet the needs of most business scenarios. However, with the continuous development of cloud computing and the continuous innovation of hardware technology, the throughput and delay of BRPC network communication are put forward higher requirements. Therefore, BRPC should not only be satisfied with the high performance of many years ago, but should further improve throughput and latency, and maximize the current hardware capabilities to meet the current business needs.

This sharing will take cloud storage as an example to describe baidu's BRPC adaptation practices to improve BRPC performance in cloud storage scenarios. It mainly includes three parts: one is the transformation of BRPC thread model, using user-mode TCP and DPDK technology to speed up data receiving and receiving; Second, the BRPC code and use modules, mainly including atomic variables, IOBuf and serialization tailoring and optimization; Third, the BRPC using RDMA transformation design, give full play to rDMA performance advantages. The above transformation of BRPC has been connected with the CDS cloud disk team of Baidu Cloud Storage, and has been put into operation on a large scale. This greatly improves the front-end IOPS performance of Baidu cloud storage CDS products.

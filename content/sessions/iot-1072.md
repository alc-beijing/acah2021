Speech introduction: This speech will start from the MQTT protocol itself, introduce the application of MQTT protocol in the millet Internet of Things scenario and how millet successfully realizes the technical architecture iteration of MQTT message gateway from practice.
Outline:
- Overview of MQTT protocol and Xiaomi application scenarios
This section briefly introduces the basic functions and characteristics of MQTT protocol, as well as the application scenarios and typical cases of MQTT in the Xiaomi IoT ecosystem
- Development history of MI MQTT technology
- Architecture Evolution
This section mainly introduces the problems encountered by Xiaomi in the process of landing the Internet of Things message gateway for the throughput performance, real-time, reliability and other aspects of the RocketMQ-MQTT architecture and the solution ideas
- Complete functions and features
The MQTT protocol V5.0 version has added some new functions and constraints. This section mainly explains Xiaomi's selection of the functions of the new version, and how to achieve functions such as MQTT authentication, shared subscription, QoS2 and CleanSession to enable Xiaomi IoT business
- Disaster recovery system construction
This section mainly introduces the process of Mi MQTT disaster recovery system from scratch, and how to integrate the disaster recovery capabilities of both sides of the end-cloud to jointly ensure the high availability of Mi IoT message communication scenarios
- Summary and future planning
RocketMQ-MQTT in the millet IoT scene has entered a stage of rapid development, the future in addition to continue to introduce the new features of MQTT 5.0 protocol, such as point-to-point messages, retained messages, wills messages, etc., will also explore more functions that can greatly improve business performance, such as physical models, rules engines, etc

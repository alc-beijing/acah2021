Does it seem strange to you that we collectively collaborate on code but training material is produced individually in private? Why would each company or person produce their own material when it can be sourced from a central location, under a business friendly license, and built on and modified? Or perhaps you just see better ways of producing content, then come along and listen to what the Apache Training project is doing. You'll find out how make nice presentations with simple markup that can be put under version control and exported to many formats.

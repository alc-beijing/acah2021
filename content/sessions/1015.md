Apache Sling is an innovative web framework built on top of the Java Content Repository (JCR), that uses OSGi for its component model and fosters RESTful application design.
 

 This talk shows how Sling integrates various standard-based technologies, like OSGi and the Content Repository API for Java to create a coherent framework for web application development. We will walk through the development of a simple application with minimal effort and demonstrate how to productize the result.
 

 Apache Sling supports various access paradigms, and we will outline both REST-based and GraphQL approaches.

The Apache Software Foundation's projects and their communities play a critical role in leading and developing the OSS ecosystems in China where some leading IT enterprises and individuals, such as Huawei, Alibaba, Baidu, Tencent, Kyligence, SkyWalking, etc., are leading the way in contributing to many ASF projects, open-sourcing their projects, donating to and incubating their projects at ASF, graduating as top-level project of ASF, developing their respective ASF project communities in China, last but not least, advocating the Apache Way when and wherever possible. This reach-out and engage-in journey, starting 2014, to build and cross the culture, language and diversity bridge does not come easy. A story of sweat and tears to share and interact with the audience.

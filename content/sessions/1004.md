What is the difference between the ASF Tomcat distribution and the various flavors of tomcat packages on Linux? Most users donâ€™t know! In this discussion Coty will explain how the tomcat packages distributed by a couple flavors of Linux (Red Hat and Debian/Ubuntu) are structured and why the container is provided that way. Coty also hopes to get feedback from the audience and to discuss how these Linux distributions can better provide tomcat to users.

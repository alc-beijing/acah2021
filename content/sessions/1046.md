CDN-in-a-Box is a subproject within Apache Traffic Control (ATC) to build a test/experimental CDN in docker on an individual workstation. The process is still challenging, so I'd like to do a workshop to guide interested users through the process on their own laptops.   The goal is to show them how the CDN works at a fairly low level and how to test that the various parts work as expected as well as troubleshooting if things go awry.   This would hopefully drum up more interest in participation in the ATC project.

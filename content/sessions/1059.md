When you start developing serverless applications in the real world, sooner rather than later you will need to talk to external (legacy) systems. In this talk you will discover how to leverage Apache Camel K to connect your Knative serverless applications with everything Camel can connect.nApache Camel K allows running Camel routes as serverless applications directly on top of any Kubernetes cluster, leveraging Knative serverless capabilities such as auto-scaling, scaling to zero, event-based communication in order to connect serverless functions and microservice with external systems.

Therefore, rocketmq community has launched many subprojects to support different technical directions. For example, rocketmq operator is mainly used to support the automatic deployment and operation of rocketmq on k8s platform. Multi language client project can make the application program developed by C + +, python, golang and other languages use rocketmq and so on.

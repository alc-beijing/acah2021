In the 5G era, the Internet of everything, more and more enterprises expect to further compute and process the Internet of Things data through the existing data analysis business center. At present, a large number of enterprise business middle desk architectures introduce message queue RocketMQ for peak clipping, decoupling, and message notification. So can you reuse RocketMQ to complete the flow of data from massive iot devices to the data analysis service center (that is, message queue RocketMQ)? Therefore, I will introduce the MQTT-RocketMQ Connect architecture from the following aspects, which can realize the flow of massive data between MQTT and RocketMQ message queues:
1. Background
2. Architecture design of MQTT-RocketMQ Connect
3. Containerization practice of MQTT-RocketMQ Connect
4. MQTT-RocketMQ Connect's practice of mass data flow on mobile cloud
5. Summary and outlook

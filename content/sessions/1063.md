CAN bus is very popular communication standard in cars, however use of it spans above that market. It is widely adopted in building and industrial control systems. Thanks to its arbitration and prioritization capabilities CAN, despite its age, is still system of choice for multiple applications.
 This presentation will describe very briefly major versions of CAN bus specifications. We will clarify some of most common misunderstandings with protocol versions.
 The main part of presentation will outline major troubles with implementation of application layer protocols for CAN bus systems. We will have a look at different ways to programmatically access bus to finally see how to interact with it from Java runtime.
 Continuation of presentation will outline major architectural parts of Apache PLC4X and way how application and transport layers can be used in companion to bridge gap coming from heterogeneous bus access APIs.
 Finally we will also have a deeper look at CANopen and communication paradigms with real life examples of use.

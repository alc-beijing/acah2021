China Merchants Bank(CMB) has petabytes of data stored in RDBMS, NoSQL databases, object storage, big data frameworks â€“ Apache Hadoop, Spark, Flink and so on. It is costly to transfer data from different data sources by ETL method. Hence, openLookeng is introduced to connect disparate data sources, and process data locally across datacenters and hybrid clouds. 
 

 This talk will provide an overview of the data processing engine in CMB which enables in-situ analytics on geographically remote data sources. And how we use the features of openLookeng, like high availability, auto-scaling, built-in caching and indexing support, etc. to meet enterprise workload demand with required reliability.

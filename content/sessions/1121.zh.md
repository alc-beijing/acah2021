DBS is a leading bank headquartered in Singapore.
 

 As a major banking institution, DBS generates terabytes of structured and unstructured data that can be used to get the data insights and create strategies for the bank.
 

 DBS decided in the year 2020 to invest in a CarbonData based data platform to drive real-time analytics and unlock insights on the available data from a variety of sources.
 

 In this talk we’ll first explain why and how DBS embarked from a classical data warehouse to a CarbonData based Data-lake using Spark, Presto engines.
 

 We’ll outline the series of use-cases and highlight for each use-case the advantages of CarbonData and how the team further tuned performance to truly deliver insights with continuous flow of streaming data and batch data.

It has been said that data are the new oil. The de facto standard is HTTP APIs to connect oil pipelines between heterogeneous systems, whether plain, RESTful or REST. But no company just exposes their information system to the outside.

You need a central unified entry-point to handle cross-cutting concerns: classic ones like authentication and IP blacklisting and API-related ones like rate limiting and canary release.

In this workshop, we will use Apache APISIX on Docker to show a couple of nifty features that can help your information system cope with the challenges introduced by APIs.

Routing your calls to the correct upstream

Available abstractions: Route, Upstream, Service

The Apache APISIX dashboard

Configuring APISIX with the dashboard

Configuring APISIX with the command-line

Monitoring APISIX

Low-code Plugin Orchestration

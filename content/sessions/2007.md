Jono Bacon has spent 22 years working in open source, and while his career has overall been a successful one, he has experienced plenty of failure.
In this keynote session, Jono will share some of the most critical mistakes he has made and how you can not just learn from them, but to use them as a way to be more successful. His guidance will be practical, giving you plenty of material to put into action todau.
This will be an open, transparent, and at times vulnerable keynote with plenty of food for thought of what to do and what not to do.

Distributed tracing has become more and more essential in the field of observability, but sometimes when using Tracing to analyze the cause of the problem, it's difficult to find out why the execution time of a Span is so long.
 I will introduce common analysis methods for this problem and take the Profiling function in SkyWalking as an example to introduce how it is used to achieve code-level execution time positioning.

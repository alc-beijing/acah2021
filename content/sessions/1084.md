Good code isn't enough for a successful open source project. First of all, only you know how to use what you've made. Maybe it's time for a little UI and UX help? At the very least some documentation! Next, how is anyone else going to find what you've created? And that's only the beginning. Ruth Suehle, manager of Red Hat's Open Source and Standards community leadership team, will take you through examples of the best and the worst, from projects large and small, to help you see what you need beyond your code to build a successful open source project and community.

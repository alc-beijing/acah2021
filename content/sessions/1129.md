Observability is quite important for the cloud native application. Itncould be a challenge if we build up the system observer from thenstrache. By leveraging the Skywalking's extension mechanism, we couldnsend out the data to the backend directly to improve thenObservability of the Cloud Native Service. In distributed applications, horizontal sharding and transactio coordination are most popular solutions. Observability for businessninvocation on sharding scenario are not enough; but observer allnsharded details of backend infrastructures indifferently are tooncomplicated. We need a whole picture of SQL and transactions execution status. ShardingSphere is a transport databases middleware for sharding and aggregation service solution; ServiceComb is a micro service and distributed transaction solution. In this talk we will share our integration with Skywalking, which can observe a modern, complicated, distributed system immediately.

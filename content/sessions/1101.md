As one of key open source rules, “community over code” has been accepted by most open source projects. Building an active community around project is recognized as an important sign to measure a project is mature or not. Thus, many open source foundations has explicit item on their checking list for project graduation from incubator status. However, different foundations (Apache, Linux and OpenAtom) could have slightly different practices across projects. In this session, speaker will share some lesson learned from over 10 years open source contributions.

The Internet of Things (IoT) is all about connected devices that produce and exchange data, and building applications that produce insights from these high volumes of data are very challenging and require an understanding of multiple protocols, platforms, and other components. On this session, we will start by providing a quick introduction to IoT, some of the common analytic patterns used on IoT, and also touch on the MQTT protocol and how it is used by IoT solutions some of the quality of services tradeoffs to be considered when building an IoT application. We will also discuss some of the Apache Spark platform components, the ones utilized by IoT applications to process devices streaming data. We will also talk about Apache Bahir and some of its IoT connectors available for the Apache Spark platform. We will also go over the details on how to build, test and deploy an IoT application for Apache Spark using the MQTT data source for the new Apache Spark Structure Streaming functionality.

Vivo Mobile Internet aims to provide the ultimate Internet products and services for the 350 million Vivo smartphone users worldwide. At present, it has established a complete mobile Internet ecosystem, operating around Vivo big data, creating a full-service ecosystem including applications, games, information, brands, e-commerce, content, finance and search.
Over the past few years, we have supported terabyte/day ETL, recommendation, Push, monitoring and other Internet services with multiple Kafka clusters. We have now chosen Apache Pulsar as our next-generation messaging middleware to address the challenges of higher-order data.
In this talk, I will share the reasons for choosing Pulsar, the practical experience of Pulsar from 0 to 1 and the problem solving ideas, the seamless migration solution from Kafka to Pulsar, and the planning outlook for the future.

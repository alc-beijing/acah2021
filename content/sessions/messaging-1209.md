vivo looks to provide excellent Internet products and services for 350 million vivo smartphone users worldwide. Currently, it has established a complete mobile Internet ecosystem based on vivoâ€™s big data operations, featuring applications, games, information, brands, e-commerce, content, finance and search.
Over the past few years, we have used Kafka clusters to support our Internet business (for example, ETL, recommendations, push messages, and monitoring) with 1000 billion messages per day. Now, we have migrated to Apache Pulsar as our next-generation message middleware to cope with an even larger amount of data.
In this speech, I will share the reasons for choosing Pulsar, how we worked to put Pulsar into practice at vivo (including some troubleshooting insights), how we migrated from Kafka to Pulsar, and our future plans.

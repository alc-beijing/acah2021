At present, there are no available free data lake platforms to streamline data management and analytics, as Cloudera Data Platform (CDP) is no longer offered free of charge.

As more users show interest in similar platforms, Bigtop with Ambari provide free open-source solutions for the data lake stack as an alternative to CDP that can deliver faster and easier data management and analytics.

The Bigtop team, along with people from Oracle, NTT DATA, Visa, Arm and some individual developers, re-incubated Apache Ambari last year. Roman Shaposhnik, the founder of Bigtop and Director of the ASF Board, spearheaded the effort to bring Ambari back.

In this talk, we will provide an overview of the new Bigtop 3.2.0 release and an in-depth perspective on the Bigtop+Ambari solution as a data lake platform. 

Furthermore, Bigtop has started to work on supporting OpenEuler, which has over 300 organizational members and has seen significant enterprise deployments, particularly in China. We will introduce the current work status and roadmap of Bigtop on OpenEuler.

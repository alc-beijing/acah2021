As a large-scale distributed iot message access platform, EMQX can efficiently and reliably connect a large number of devices, while providing many features designed for iot scenarios, such as rules engine, MQTT over QUIC, and more. Apache IoTDB is an iot timing database designed to efficiently store, manage, and analyze large-scale iot data.

In this talk, we will explore the changes EMQX and Apache IoTDB bring to iot applications.

Speech outline:

1. What are EMQX and Apache IoTDB?
2. What are the strengths of EMQX and Apache?
3. How can you further amplify these benefits by combining EMQX with Apache IoTDB?
4. Bring more possibilities to Industrial iot through Neuron + EMQX + Apache IoTDB.

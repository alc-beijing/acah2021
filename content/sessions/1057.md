In this talk, after first providing a brief, high-level architectural comparison of Kafka and Pulsar, then we will focus on comparing the message publishing/subscribing models between Kafka and Pulsar, the similarities and differences between them, and the corresponding implications for application design and implementation. Finally, we will present the different migration options, patterns, and tools available to achieve a seamless application migration path from Kafka to Pulsar.

The MS active directory is the de facto authentication system for Windows systems in most enterprises. We can integrate with LDAP and active directory to grant domain users access to the system. In this talk, the speaker will discuss the RBAC mechanism, which is how to unify AD and Linux by verifying that LDAP users log in to Linux client computers. Concepts of Linux modules such as PAM, SSSD, NSS, and active directory concepts such as forests, domains, and so on will be discussed.
Openmeetings is Apache's TLP. Compared to other video conferencing tools, it is fully open source and browser-based. Apache openmeeting can be installed locally or in containers. Openmeetings can be integrated with LDAP & Active Directory to grant domain users access to the system.
In this talk, the speaker will detail how to configure Openmeetings to integrate LDAP and active directory, discuss configuration files from a user's perspective, and explain the classes and functions in the Apache Openmeetings code snippet. The audience should have basic knowledge of Java and LDAP. At the end of the presentation, a demonstration of development and system configuration will be given.

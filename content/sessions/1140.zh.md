Optimizing scheduling and communication of distributed data processing for resource and data characteristics is crucial for achieving high performance. In this talk, we introduce Apache Nemo, an optimization framework for distributed dataflow processing that provides fine control for high performance, and also ensures correctness for an easy user experience. In the talk, we provide a demo to show the execution flow of an Apache Beam program being run on our distributed data processing system. We demonstrate how the program is wrapped by the Nemo intermediate representation that enables compiler optimization passes and runtime extensions, and show how the optimizations can be easily and flexibly applied on dataflow applications. We also do a comparison of the evaluation results based on the optimizations.

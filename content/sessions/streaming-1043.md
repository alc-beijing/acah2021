With the deepening of digitization, data is growing explosively, which puts forward higher and higher requirements for real-time and correctness of data processing. At the same time, as a data flow platform, message queue products are widely used in big data computing architecture, and there are countless cases of flow calculation through message queue/message engine. However, in the era of cloud computing, cost of use becomes the primary goal of architecture design or evolution. RSQLDB is a distributed stream computing engine based on message queue RocketMQ storage. The minimum support for 2-node production deployment, standardized SQL interaction greatly reduces the threshold of use; Functionally, RSQLDB supports Windows, JOIN and state recovery.
This talk will introduce RSQLDB from the following aspects:
1, stream computing evolution road, why need RSQLDB
1. RSQLDB architecture design principle
2. Application practice of RSQLDB in Alibaba Cloud

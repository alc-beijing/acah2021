Apache Kafka is a de facto standard streaming data processing platform. It is widely deployed as event streaming platform. Part of Kafka is its stream processing API “Kafka Streams”. In addition, the Kafka ecosystem now offers KSQL, a declarative, SQL-like stream processing language that lets you define powerful stream-processing applications easily. What once took some moderately sophisticated Java code can now be done at the command line with a familiar and eminently approachable syntax.nThis session discusses and demos the pros and cons of Kafka Streams and KSQL to understand when to use which stream processing alternative for continuous stream processing natively on Apache Kafka infrastructures. The end of the session compares the trade-offs of Kafka Streams and KSQL to separate stream processing frameworks such as Apache Flink or Spark Streaming.

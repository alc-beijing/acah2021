It has been almost 6 years since Apache Kylin graduated as the first ASF top-level project in China, and the founding team formed the startup Kyligence to work on the productization side. Today, from a product perspective, looking back at open source projects and technologies, there are a lot of similarities and differences. In this session, we will share how Kylin is productizing an open source technology from a "product manager" perspective, and how to run open source communities and projects with a "product mindset".

Open source has recently become a very hot topic. The core of open source is not in the code, but in the community, and what is the nature of the community? Why is the community so important? How to run a good open-source software community? Is there a conflict between open source and business? These are very important questions, in this talk, I will give my thoughts on the above questions.

Event-driven architectures are having a great moment among developers. Whether they’re using Kafka as the events backbone, or a serverless environment such as Knative, developers now need new ways to connect their applications to external systems: they need connectors.
 

 Kamelets are a new technology in the Apache Camel ecosystem that provide a solution for this problem: they are general purpose connectors that are ready to use and can connect your platform to virtually any of the 300+ systems supported by Apache Camel, and much more than that.
 

 Kamelets are built with ease-of-use and extensibility in mind. Developers can use them out of the box, picking their favorite one from the constantly growing open catalog of Kamelets at Apache, or easily building their own for their specific needs, or even for their enterprise systems. Contributing to the catalog is also easy for everyone.
 

 Additionally, in case you’re not building a single application, but a platform that needs connectors for external systems, there’s no better choice than using Kamelets for connectivity, given the abstract configuration interface that they provide and make them suitable for building any kind of visual UI (we’ll see some examples).
 

 In this presentation, we’re going to explore how these new connectors are made and how they work in various contexts. With a live demo, we’re also going to see them in action using the Camel K runtime on Kubernetes, solving some real world problems.

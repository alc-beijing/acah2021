In this talk, we will introduce the Medley data integration platform used at Uber. Medley is based on the Apache Camel framework, and centered around integrating internal systems efficiently and with great precision on multiple network environments. We will focus on the concept of reusability of integrations, where integrations can be securely shared by implementing integrations as web services. Also, implementing business entity change detection with publish/subscribe to changes to allow event based integrations based on data state changes. Finally, we will describe the challenges dealing with many types of integration use cases, development processes, monitoring, and troubleshooting.

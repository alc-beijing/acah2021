Apache Linkis is a layer of computing middleware between applications and engines. 

The content of my sharing mainly includes: Why do we choose Linkis as the bigdata middleware inside the Li Auto; The features we have added and fixed during our implementation of Linkis, and how these features help us to develop simpler and improve our work efficiency; The challenges and issues we encountered during our implementation, and our solutions and suggestions; The new features and improvements in our plan. 

I hope my sharing provide some experience for teams currently using or planning to use Linkis.

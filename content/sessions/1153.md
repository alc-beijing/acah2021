In a world where everything is connected, trillions of devices are sending data in real-time to data centers. Apache Kafka as a streaming platform is the system by excellence for many years. However, there are many competitors who are making its life more difficult. In this talk, I will introduce to one of them, Apache Pulsar sponsored by Yahoo itself. Pulsar is the next generation messaging system that uses a different architecture to achieve durability, performance, scalability, efficiency, multi-tenancy and geographic replication. Besides, I will focus on why Apache Pulsar is a great streaming platform in IoT projects.

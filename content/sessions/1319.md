Kotlin is an Open Sourced, statically typed language for JVM and is mostly being favoured by Android Developers due to the many myriad features which enable more concise and cleaner code than Java without sacrificing performance or safety.
 By using Kotlin as our language of choice to build an apache beam pipeline, our development team not only ran into fewer errors than what we would have if we used Java; but with the help of extensively useful high level APIs present in Kotlin, we were also able to cut down on the development time required to build, test and deploy a new feature.
 This talk uses real life examples from my personal experiences to advocate on the benefits that you can get by using Kotlin to build solutions in Apache Beam.
 So if you are someone who is already working with Apache Beam's Java SDK, or looking forward to try Apache BEAM, attending this talk will motivate you to go ahead and explore the benefits associated with using Beam with Kotlin.

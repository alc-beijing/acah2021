LinkedIn is the most advantageous social networking tool available to job seekers and business professionals today, with 610+ million members creating millions of posts, videos, and articles that generate tens of millions of shares, comments and likes per day. LinkedIn has leveraged this activity data to build rich interactive user-facing analytics applications like “Who Viewed My Profile”, Talent Insights, Ad Analytics and Publisher Analytics, among others. These applications are all powered by Pinot, as are internal dashboards, anomaly detection and root cause analysis platform like ThirdEye. Apache Pinot (incubating) is a distributed columnar storage engine that can ingest ndata in realtime and serve analytical queries at low latency. In this talk, we will discuss how Pinot has become the de-facto solution for serving analytic queries in milliseconds, ad-hoc reporting, monitoring & Anomaly Detection on multidimensional data.

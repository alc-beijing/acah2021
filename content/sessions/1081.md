When Apache Dolphin Scheduler joined the Apache incubation, it is the only open-source project from a small company in China. That means PPMC/PMC didn't have enough resources to build the project themselves. To build a good community is their only way to succeed. And they have learned many experiences from the open-source project which failed to build the community in the past 3 years. 
 This topic is to share the story of the success and failure experience in China. I hope our story can help contributors all over the world.

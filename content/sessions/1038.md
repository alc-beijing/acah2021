Is it a panel? Is it a talk? It is a Podling's Shark Tank! Back by popular demand with even sharkier judges! What is it, you ask? Well, this is just like Shark Tank TV show (think speed dating between entrepreneurs and investors) but instead of “Squirrel Boss” and “Man Candle” you'll be hearing pitches for Apache Incubator projects. Also instead of Mark Cuban and Kevin O'Leary you'll be pitching to the panel of ASF old timers (trying to convince them that your project is worthy of their esteemed attention and endorsement). There will be snark, there will be prizes, there will be reciting of Apache Way creed. But most of all there will be fun. We guaranteed it! And don't forget, if you want your favorite podling to be featured on the show, volunteer to do the pitch by simply signing up on this wiki page: https://wiki.apache.org/apachecon/ACNA19PodlingSharkTank

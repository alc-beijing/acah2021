Apache Traffic Control has some built-in tools for assisting in the installation and deployment of new servers; however, it is still a somewhat manual and repetitive process. I will be demonstrating how the Traffic Control API, used in conjunction with IPv6 autoconf can be used to streamline the deployment process, allowing servers to configure themselves post-install. Will highlight the use of the ‘tc-netconfig’ application, which was developed to facilitate this process.

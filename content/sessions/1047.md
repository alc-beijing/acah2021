1 Challenges facing message queues in the cloud-native era
  1.1 Dynamic scaling up and scaling down. How to achieve second-level scaling in a cloud-native environment.
  1.2 Resource utilization and resource isolation. Independent clusters of users can lead to low resource utilization, and shared cluster user resources can affect each other.
 

 2 Containerized Dynamic Scaling
  2.1 Pulsar's Broker is stateless, and Broker and Bookie practice dynamic scale-up and scale-down via cloud-native environments.
  2.2 Physical migration vs. logical migration. How to achieve second-level migration without downtime on the Broker side when scaling; how traditional message queues often face data migration with long time, and how to perform second-level migration on the storage layer;
 

 3 Resource Utilization and Isolation
  3.1 Physical clusters vs. logical clusters. Logical clusters allow for fuller utilization of resources.
  3.2 Dynamic resource planning and logical isolation. How to ensure that resources are not affected by each other while making full use of them.
 

 4 Future Outlook
  4.1 More lightweight. Tencent Cloud is doing Pulsar's de-Zookeeper
  4.2 Bigger capacity. Single cluster supports millions of levels of Topic/Partition"

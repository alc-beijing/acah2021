'Traffic-control was built as an ISP CDN, serving content within a single ISP. Using traffic-control for creating a multi-ISP CDN, puts up challenges in various aspects: starting from the deployment of the different TC components outside of the ISPs, towards the isolation between different ISPs, as well as self-service, dealing simultaneously with different structures of ISP networks, the changing popularity of content in different ISP etc. In this session we would like to described few of the above challenges, as well as the derived traffic-control components requirements, flexibility and modularity.'

At Comcast we have a unique challenge of serving both static and live linear content via our CDN. In general a thundering herd (multiple instantaneous simultaneous requests for the same content) is not a large concern for static files barring a few situations like serving automatic pushed update files. However when serving live content the nature of it means you are almost always generating a herd or on the verge of it due to timing. This talk covers some of the issues we have seen while growing our CDN to serve both live and static content and the solutions we have come to with regards to using Apache Traffic Server as our main caching software.

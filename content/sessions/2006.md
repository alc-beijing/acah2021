We need open source now, more than ever. There is an urgent need to foster global connections, knowledge exchange and cross-border collaboration. Only by working together can we make bigger strides in solving some of the world’s most pressing problems. People from around the world work together on open source projects. They show every day how a fruitful and successful collaboration on a global scale to the benefit of all is possible despite different views, personal and historical backgrounds and experiences. In this session, Hong Phuc Dang will speak about the state of open source software and hardware - challenges and opportunities. What we have learned from the pandemic, how individuals can contribute and help to build global solutions the open source way.

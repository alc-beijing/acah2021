In the industrial IoT sector one question always bugged me, as it was usually a show-stopper: "Is this stuff certified?" 
 

 Let's face it! Open-Source and Certified software usually doesn't match. So I invested a lot of thought, how to blast this argument off the table. What we came up with in the Apache PLC4X project was: Passive Mode Drivers.
 

 With our Passive Mode Drivers we are able to make IoT data available in insecure networks without compromising the high-security production network. 
 

 Let me take you on a tour through what we call: Secure by design IIoT communication.

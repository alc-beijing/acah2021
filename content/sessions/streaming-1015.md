At Flink Forward Asia in 2022, we proposed for the first time the Flink Shuffle 3.0 architecture with cloud native, stream batch fusion, and adaptive as the core.

The new Shuffle architecture has the following advantages:
- More suitable for resource orchestration and isolation in cloud-native environments
- Combine the advantages of traditional streaming and batch Shuffle technology
- It can make adaptive adjustments according to the resources and load of the runtime, which is easier to use

In this share, we will introduce the latest progress and future planning of Flink version 1.18 in this regard.

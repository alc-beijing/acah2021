Inspired by Google's Felipe Hoffa's effort/talk, this attempt is to replicate an usecase of exploring github data using Apache Drill and lessons learnt. Apache Drill is a distributed MPP query layer that supports SQL and alternative query languages against NoSQL and Hadoop data storage systems. The talk will highlight steps to build Apache Drill from source code, and showcase a demo analyzing terabytes of github data (issues and comments), running on a cluster of 3 node ARM64 servers.

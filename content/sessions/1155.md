Nginx is often the first thing that comes to mind when it comes to limiting traffic and speed. However, Nginx is implemented through a configuration file, which requires a reload every time you make a change, making it extremely cumbersome to run and maintain. On the other hand, speed limiting conditions are restricted to Nginx variables, making it difficult for Nginx to achieve fine-grained speed limiting for business purposes.

This session will show how to use Apache APISIX to achieve dynamic, fine-grained, distributed rate-limiting, and how to use plug-in orchestration to achieve rate-limiting that better meets your business needs.

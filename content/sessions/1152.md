The Apache Commons Project is home to one of the more widely consumed Java utility functions, namely “StringUtils.isBlank(String str);”. But when you look beyond commons-lang, you’ll find a wide array of heavily utilized and extremely useful tools. For example, commons-cli is the command line parser used by the Apache Maven project; commons-fileupload is heavily used by both Apache Tomcat and Apache Struts; commons-text is heavily used by Apache Hadoop; and commons-dbcp is a database connection pool used across Tomcat as well as the Spring Framework. We’ll look at some common problems facing developers today and how the Apache Commons Project can address them, diving into specific examples as we go.

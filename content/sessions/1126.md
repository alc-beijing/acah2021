Every Cassandra operator has been hit with a couple of weird/complex cases that don't fit the normal expected failure situation. It can be a problem in hardware, software, networking, operator mistake, or a mix of it all. In this talk we will go through a compilation of such cases that we faced. How do they appear, how did we debug them and how did we fix them. We expect this to be a walk through weird, fun cases and sharing knowledge on the situations and on the fixing of such problems

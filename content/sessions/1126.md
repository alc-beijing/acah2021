With the application and development of big data technologies, there are more types of data, more data distribution, and more complex query scenarios. This makes it difficult or impossible to process data easily. To improve the usability of big data, Huawei initiated the open source project openLooKeng, the data virtualization engine. openLooKeng uses the industry-renowned open source SQL engine Presto to provide basic interactive query and analysis capabilities, and continues to develop in cross-data center/cloud, data source expansion, performance, reliability, security etc., making big data simplified.
 This talk will focus on the openLooKeng heuristic index framework, then introduce severial indexing technologies based on the framework and its implementation and application challenges.

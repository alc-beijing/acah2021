Object storage is awesome. Amazon S3, Google Cloud Storage, Azure Blob, and others offer storage with near-infinite capacity, high availability, really high durability, low cost … and very slow performance. Databases need high performance storage to query billions of rows and deliver rapid results. How can data services take advantage of object storage without being held back by performance? The answer is all about architecture - designing databases that can use storage design and parallelization to get high performance where it’s needed while getting the capacity, resilience, and scale from S3 and other object stores.

Gian Merlino, Apache Druid® committer and co-founder of Imply will show how the data revolution is happening today, describing and demonstrating systems that use cloud object storage to deliver high-performance systems for interactive data conversations with high concurrency and low latency combining stream and batch data while controlling and minimizing costs.

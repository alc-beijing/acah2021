In this session, you will learn all that’s new with Apache Unomi, the open source Customer Data platform (that graduated this year) based on the Apache Karaf runtime, and all that’s happened since the last ApacheCon. You will discover how to easily integrate it with an existing website or SPA/PWA using its built-in web tracker, how to build customer segments and how to use the API to personalize the experience for your users. You’ll also learn how you can extend it to do almost anything, using either the built-in rules engine or your own plugins. You will also discover the new Docker compatibility and the upcoming GraphQL API. Finally, you’ll learn what’s next and how you can help the project.

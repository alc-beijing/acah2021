Hello all,
This is Ayush Das ,an engineering student from india.

In the past few months, Apache APISIX community users have added many plugins to Apache APISIX, enriching the ecosystem of Apache APISIX. From the user's point of view, the emergence of more diverse plug-ins is undoubtedly a good thing. On the basis of improving the high performance and low latency of Apache APISIX, they meet the users' more expectations for the gateway, that is, "one Station" and "Multifunction".

So this time, let's change our perspective, from the perspective of plugin developers, let's take a look at the whole process of the birth of a plugin!

Today, i will be developing developing the file-logger plugin by a front-end engineer no back-end experience. Before explaining the implementation process in detail, let me briefly introduce the functions of file-logger .

file-logger supports the use of Apache APISIX plug-in metadata to generate custom log formats. Users can use the file-logger plug-in to append JSON-formatted request and response data to log files, or push the Log data stream to a specified location.

Imagine that when monitoring the access log of a route, we often focus not only on the value of some request and response data, but also want to write the log data to the specified file separately. At this time, you can use the file-logger plug-in to help achieve these requirements.

Pasting blocks outside Docs is not supported

In the specific implementation process, we can use file-logger to write the log data to the specified log file separately to simplify the process of monitoring and debugging.

After introducing you all the function of file-logger, i guess now everyone from you has a better understanding of this plugin. The following is a detailed tutorial for you. , who has no server-side experience,

and now the coding part starts.

summary-
The above is the whole process of implementing an Apache APISIX plugin from 0 to 1 as a back-end novice. I did encounter a lot of pitfalls in the process of developing the plug-in. Fortunately, there are many enthusiastic bigwigs in the Apache APISIX community to help me solve my doubts, which made the development and testing of the file-logger plug-in smooth. If you are interested in this plugin, or want to see the plugin details, you can refer to Apache APISIX official document .

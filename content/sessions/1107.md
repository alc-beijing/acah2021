Open source and opensource communities became one of the most important way of software development, there are tons of new open source projects and communities appears each year or even each day. 
 

 In order to make the open source community/project successful, the creativity and quality of the project itself is just one part of story, the infrastructure behind the community is just as important. An infrastructure system that is powerful, effective and easy-to-use can not only help your community/project development more smooth, providing high quality codes and attract more contributors, it can also help you reduce costs and operation manpowers significantly.
 

 OSINFRA is the infrastructure system behind four major open source communities: openEuler, openGauss, openLooKeng and MindSpore, supporting the everyday development for over 7.5k developers. In this session, we would like to share our experiences and best practise about how it is done and what are the future plans.It could be useful for audiences that want to run their own open source projects/communities.

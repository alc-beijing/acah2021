Distributed tracking technology is particularly important in the field of observables, prompting more attention to the ease of use of tracking probes in various languages. At present, most of the probes in golang language are manually embedded probes, and the access process is too complicated and the limitations are very strong. The focus of this discussion is on simplifying the way golang probes are accessed, making innovative use of automatic burying technology, and breaking through the constraints of contextual information dependency in many frameworks.

Hybrid applications can be a great solution for cross platform development, but JavaScript is not everyones cup of coffee. With a small set of clever APIs and SPIs, NetBeans has created a lean cross platform framework, that allows you to code in Java, and run the application on any mobile or desktop platform, as hybrid, or fully native application. In this sessions I'd like to unveil this hidden gem (improperly named 'HTML/Java'), show some real life applications and discuss how this improves client side software development dramatically.

How can you leverage the flexibility and extreme scale in the public cloud combined with your Apache Kafka ecosystem to build scalable, mission-critical machine learning infrastructures, which span multiple public clouds or bridge your on-premise data centre to cloud? nThis talk will discuss and demo how you can leverage machine learning technologies such as TensorFlow with your Kafka deployments in public cloud to build a scalable, mission-critical machine learning infrastructure for data ingestion and processing, and model training, deployment and monitoring.nThe discussed architecture includes capabilities like scalable data preprocessing for training and predictions, combination of different Deep Learning frameworks, data replication between data centres, intelligent real time microservices running on Kubernetes, and local deployment of analytic models for offline predictions.

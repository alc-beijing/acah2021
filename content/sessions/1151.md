Apache has a 20 year history of building resilient and sustainable communities of software developers through the Apache Way.  While some companies are adopting Inner sourcing, other companies still have a taboo surrounding open source culture.  Many of us work at these open source agnostic companies and don’t have manager in our title. Are those of us in those companies doomed to a life of Dilbert? You don’t have to be! This talk is all about how to bring a little Apache culture to your Apache oblivious team. This talk will cover how a little Apache Way goes a long way solving common team problems with knowledge sharing, technical/personal disputes, mentorship, and shipping software. So even though you’re the only one on your team that “gets” Apache, everyone can share in the rewards of being a part of an effective team.

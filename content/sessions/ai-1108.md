With the complexity of computing tasks and the increase of data volume, the traditional general computing platform has been unable to meet the needs of high performance computing. With the acceleration of heterogeneous computing systems, different computing platforms have different instruction sets and architecture characteristics. The compiler architecture for heterogeneous computing can provide higher performance and efficiency, and support seamless integration between different types of computing units and platforms, thus promoting the development and innovation of computing technology.

This session shows how to develop and run native mobile apps without needing to know much about the native platforms, such as Android and iOS, by leveraging a hybrid development framework such as Apache Cordova, which is capable of transforming an ordinary web app into a mobile app. The presentation discusses a real-life enterprise-level Android and iOS mobile app developed under pressure for a wireless service provider.

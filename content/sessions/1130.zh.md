Apache YuniKorn (Incubating) is a light-weight, universal resource scheduler for container orchestrator systems. It was created to achieve fine-grained resource sharing for various workloads efficiently on a large scale, multi-tenant, and cloud-native environment. YuniKorn brings a unified, cross-platform, scheduling experience for mixed workloads that consist of stateless batch workloads and stateful services.
 

 As a custom K8s scheduler, YuniKorn can be easily deployable in K8s on-prem or on cloud. For this talk, we will talk about gaps in resource scheduling in Cloud-Native environment, and how YuniKorn can support running big data applications (like Spark/Flink/Tensorflow, etc.) on K8s. 
 

 We will share the advantages for onboarding Spark workloads in to K8s by using Yunikorn's gang scheduling support. This is one of the biggest paintpoints for Big Data workload migration to Cloud-Native ecosystem. We will also share how YuniKorn being used in community partners such as Apple, Aplibaba, Cloudera, etc.

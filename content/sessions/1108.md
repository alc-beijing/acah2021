While Machine learning and data mining has had profound impact on how we model applications and use data for better product consumption, there is scope for extending prediction algorithms to lower levels as well. Some useful applications of machine learning in ACS could be exploring better resource allocation that is aware of usage statistics, predicting faults, load balancing, etc. In this talk we will * take a broad overview of what Machine Learning/Data mining is and how it is being used in today's tech ecosystemn* explore ways in which we can make ACS more efficientn* discuss some recent advancements in how ML can benefit datacenters from research community

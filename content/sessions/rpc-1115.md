In this presentation, we will comprehensively discuss how to build a front-end and back-end interconnected microservices system based on Dubbo. The Dubbo Triple protocol is designed as a universal RPC protocol built on top of HTTP, which is easily accessible by browsers, compatible with gRPC, and supports streaming communication. It can run on both HTTP/1 and HTTP/2 protocols. With the features of the Dubbo Triple protocol and the multi-language SDK provided by Dubbo, we can easily implement a front-end and back-end interconnected microservices system based on Dubbo. For example, Dubbo provides a Java client that allows developers to write web applications that work on the browser side. Using Dubbo's Node.js, Java, Go, Rust, and other back-end language SDKs, we can build a back-end interconnected microservices system.

This presentation aims at showcasing the Apache Kibble project, getting new users set up with their own Kibble instance and getting started with project and community metrics. During this talk, the audience will learn what Apache Kibble is, what it does, HOW it does it, and how you can easily get set up in a few minutes and start reviewing metrics from your own project. We will also show a demo instance with a select handful of Apache projects, and dive into both single community metrics as well as comparative measuring across foundations. This presentation is aimed at both audiences wishing to start using community metrics and KPIs on their own hardware, as well as people just along for a quick demo of the project. The presentation will end with a discussion about KPIs and areas where these metrics can improve.

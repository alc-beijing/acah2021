Typical stream computing mainly focuses on the processing scenario of table model, but how to process and analyze the flow of graph model is still difficult to support. This share mainly introduces Ant's self-developed streaming graph engine GeaFlow, and how GeaFlow's ability to build a streaming graph query language around Apache Calcite and Apache Gremlin. It will also share the practice and application of flow graph computing in ants.

The next wave of open source developers will come from not only mature economies but increasingly from emerging markets and developing nations, many of which are in the APAC region. This global-scale growth presents both new opportunities and new challenges. This presentation will discuss who these new developers are, what they need to succeed, and how the global open source community can better support them.

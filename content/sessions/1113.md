Diversity and Inclusion has always been an important part of our ASF project communities. Being able to work and collaborate remotely with a wide range of people has been a core strength in the growth of all our communities. How we attract, welcome and collaborate with a wide range of contributors can sometimes be difficult. What signals can communities give to show that they want and value diverse contributors? And once you attract these contributors, how to do we know or measure how well we are doing?
 

 In this talk I will discuss some of the challenges we continue to face in becoming diverse communities and also identify some strategies and tools that may be able to help.

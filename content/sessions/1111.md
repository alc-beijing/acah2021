During the operation of the open source community, we have many methods, indicators, and tools. However, above all these, the most important thing is still people, the communication between people, the feelings generated in the process of communication, and the creativity generated due to sudden inspiration, which should be called "mind skill". This is the most difficult part of the open-source community operation.

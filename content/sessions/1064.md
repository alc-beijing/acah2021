Rewriting URLs, or 'remapping', is probably the single most used feature of the Traffic Servernproxy. With the transition to YAML from a proprietary line based format, it was decided to startnover with effectively a blank slate, to design a configuration with a functionality emphasizingnpower and flexibility over compatibility. This talk will elaborate on the decision path leading upnto this complete restructuring, the design of the configuration, and examples of its use. Thenunderlying implementation will be sketched out to show some of the interesting C++ techniques usednto make it possible.

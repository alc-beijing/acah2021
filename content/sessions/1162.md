Apache APISIX is one of the leading API gateway OSS. To ensure everything works as intended, APISIX uses different kinds of tests including unit, e2e, and fuzzing tests. However, we are still uncertain about how APISIX would perform when some abnormal but inevitable situations happen, say network faults, IO stress, or pod failure.
 

 So here we use Chaos Mesh, a Kubernetes-based Chaos Engineering Platform to smoothly inject different kinds of chaos, and integrate them into our CI pipelines. At the end of this talk, the audiences would get to know in which aspects would Chaos Engineering benefit API gateway, and how to integrate Chaos Mesh into your own testing pipeline.

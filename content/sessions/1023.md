I'd like to cover the landscape of D&I in tech, then in open source, and then in the ASF. I'd like to discuss the dimensions used to evaluate our current status and I'd like to discuss the efforts we're working on to changer things. I will like to give this talk in the general track to a) celebrate the 20th Anniversary by reflecting back in our wins on diversity and inclusion and b) make it part of the foundation's big picture

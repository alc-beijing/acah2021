The R programming language, though initially focused on statistics, has evolved into a true general purpose programming language. R allows easily leveraging other languages such as C, C++, Python, and, more recently, JavaScript.
 

 This talk is about the integration of ECharts with R (echarts4r) to enable programmers to (very) easily create interactive charts from various R datasets, models, and more.
 

 The echarts4r package balances easy-of-use and customisability; one can create most ECharts plots in just 2-3 lines of code but nonetheless customise every aspect of chart: all options of the original JavaScript library are accessible from the R integration, and all chart types are integrated.

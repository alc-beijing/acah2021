Hosting programming community events is an effective way to encourage students to participate in open source projects and join the open source community. Open Source Summer is a summer open source event organized by the Chinese Academy of Sciences Software, similar to Google Summer of Code (GSOC), which is the pioneer of such activities in China. As the first campus pioneer of Open Source Summer, this talk aims to share the experience and harvest of open source on campus. It includes some of the difficulties students have encountered in participating in open source communities, how communities can effectively guide students to actively participate in open source projects, and some of the lessons learned in open source evangelism as a campus ambassador.

In addition, for students who want to get involved or are getting involved in open source, I have written a documentation project called Open Source Summer Best Practices to provide relevant help for students interested in open source.

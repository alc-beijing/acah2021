Camel Quarkus is an extension of Quarkus framework to use the camel dsl and it could be compiled to the native execution by using the Graal VM. In this talk, I want to introduce the basic idea of Camel Quarkus and how we do to improve the performance by leveraging the Quarkus build time optimization.
 ### Speakers: 
 Zheng Feng (冯征) : I work for Red Hat since 2009 and contribute to many upstream open source projects as well as the apache camel recently. My interests are related to the transactions and middleware.

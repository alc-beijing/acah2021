Real-time data lakes are a core component of modern data architectures that allow businesses to analyze and query large amounts of data in real time. In this sharing, we will first introduce the current pain points of the real-time data lake, such as high timeliness, diversity, consistency and accuracy of data. Then, we describe how to build a real-time data lake based on Flink and Iceberg, mainly through the following two parts: how to enter the data into the lake in real time and how to use Flink for OLAP temporary query. Finally, some practical benefits of Bytedance in real-time data lake are introduced.

Big data format played an important role in data analytics for data storage efficiency, query performance, and security. In this talk, we will present our work in big data file format, Apache Parquet, at Uber for reducing storage size by ~20% to save millions of dollars, and encrypting columns to provide fine-grained access control. We will show the work we contributed to open source Parquet including ZSTD compression, high throughput column pruner, column size estimator, column encryption management, etc. On the query performance side, we will demonstrate our work related to Column Index, which is a new feature in Parquet 1.11.0.


 Not only big data file format but also in-memory format, i.e. Apache Arrow, is one of the areas we look into. Use Apache Arrow as a cache layer would vastly improve the performance. We will show our vision at Uber for big data format.

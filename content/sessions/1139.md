Scalar DB is an open source library released under Apache 2 which realizes ACID-compliant transactions on Cassandra, without requiring any modifications to Cassandra itself. It achieves strongly-consistent, linearly scalable, and highly available transactions. This talk will present the theory and practice behind Scalar DB, as well as providing some benchmark results and use cases.

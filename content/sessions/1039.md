Nginx is not friendly about Observability, the only solution is analyzing the log files, no dynamic, and the cost is high. 
APISIX enhances a lot about this, covers most parts of observability, and with SkyWalking's support, the observability increased.
The immigration from Nginx to APISIX is low, so, all Nginx stack users could easily adopt APISIX to get a better observability out of box.

So you've been hearing a lot of buzz about Serverless tech in conjunction with Containers and Mobile, but what exactly is the OpenWhisk in reference to Kubernetes? Come find out at this session. Serverless has become the new style of coding, and it might be perfect to offload your mobile apps, and container based systems without incurring unnecessary costs.nGet an intro into serverless/function-as-a-service/cloud native technologies in the Mobile-Backend-as-a-Service (MBaaS) context and learn why startups and enterprises are so excited about using it. We will be demoing Serverless and containers in Swift and iOS, and in Java for Android, and covering the following:n- Who are the players  in the serverless ecosystemn- What are some use cases for serverless and container based solutions - with MBaaS as one of themn- Best practices for the serverless with the container system architecture for MBaaSn- If going serverless is really faster, better, cheaper for developers and organizationsn- Live coding examples using Swift and Java

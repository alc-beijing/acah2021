MQ, ETL and ESB middleware are often used as integration backbone between legacy applications, modern microservices and cloud services. This introduces several challenges and complexities like point-to-point integration or non-scalable architectures. This session discusses how to build a completely event-driven streaming platform leveraging Apache Kafka’s open source messaging, integration and streaming components to leverage distributed processing, fault-tolerance, rolling upgrades and the ability to reprocess events. nLearn the differences between an event-driven streaming platform leveraging Apache Kafka and middleware like MQ, ETL and ESBs – including best practices and anti-patterns, but also how these concepts and tools complement each other in an enterprise architecture.

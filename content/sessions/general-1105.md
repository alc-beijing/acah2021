EventMesh is a new generation of serverless event middleware that simplifies event-driven architecture, improves development efficiency, uses a microkernel plug-in design, and has a rich out-of-the-box event connector that provides a variety of off-the-shelf features without having to build an event connector from scratch. It complies with CNCF Serverlesswork-flow standard event orchestration, supports the standard PubSub event publishing subscription model, and seamlessly integrates with different event stores, message brokers, and cloud platforms. This speech mainly introduces the implementation and practice of EventMesh in Huawei Cloud from the aspects of architecture planning, ecological construction, and practice cases.

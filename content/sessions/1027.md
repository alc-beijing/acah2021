At almost two years in the making Apache Cassandra 4.0 is almost here. With a focus on performance and stability, it is full of interesting features. This talk takes you through a tour of the new features and performance improvements. From Zero Copy Faster Streaming support to Virtual Tables and Audit Logging, learn how Apache Cassandra 4.0 has departed from previous major releases to be focused on the features required by the most demanding users. Attendees will not only gain an understanding of new features in Apache Cassandra, but understand what drove their creation and therefore have a better idea of how to best use these features in their own systems.

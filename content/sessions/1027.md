Modern businesses make real-time data-driven decisions with Apache Druid. One of the key challenges is to design a reliable ingestion pipeline. Some of these challenges are primarily because the nature of the queries varies from customer to customer and use case to use case.

In this talk, we will cover some of the best practices in setting up real-time ingestion Apache Druid with Apache Kafka. We will also discuss some of the advanced tips on optimizing real-time ingestion, query performance and reliability.

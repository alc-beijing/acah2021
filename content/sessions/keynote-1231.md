The open-source community is like an organic biological system. This speech will explore the driving force behind community development, discussing the power of community from various perspectives such as purpose, principle, process, and products. Community is people, revealing that the most core and valuable aspect of a community is every individual within it. We will explore the source of motivation and benefits for each person contributing to the community. Even the most outstanding and successful projects lose their vitality without a sense of community and the involvement of open-source contributors. Therefore, whether it is a corporate open-source project or a personal or foundation-maintained project, it requires excellent developers to invest in the open-source cause in a self-driven manner for the long term, holding a long-term perspective and enjoying the sense of achievement and happiness brought by open-source.

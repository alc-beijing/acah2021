nCloudStack currently supports Kubernetes deployment using Hypervisors, which enables PaaS on top of IaaS. However, PaaS applications having data-heavy loads are the most likely to be negatively impacted, especially when the service is oversubscribed. This is where BareMetal cloud offers a significant advantage over Hypervisors, especially for latency-sensitive workloads. This talk and demo will provide turnkey solution for integrating Kubernetes on CloudStack using BareMetal servers.

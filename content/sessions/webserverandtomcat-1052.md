Dubco-go-pixiu is an open source API gateway and cluster access solution for the Dubbo ecosystem. As an API gateway, Pixiu has the ability to receive external HTTP/Dubbo/Triple network requests and convert them into Dubbo/Triple and other protocols to achieve seamless HTTP/Dubbo/Triple connection in the Dubbo ecosystem. In the upcoming 1.0 release, we will also introduce the first version of the Dubbo Mesh Proxyless control surface.

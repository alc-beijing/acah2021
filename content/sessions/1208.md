Apache Karaf has been seen for a while as an applications server. If it's actually the case for the standard distribution, it's very easy to create a Karaf powered standard/immutable distribution embedding your applications. In combination with other Karaf subprojects (Decanter, Cave, ...), it provides a perfect applications runtime for the cloud.nThis talk will show how to start and focus on business code and then generate different distribution packages, up to a docker image ready to run on cloud.

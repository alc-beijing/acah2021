Data in the 21st Century is like Oil in the 18th Century: an immensely, untapped valuable asset if processed in an intelligent way. Storage and Analysis of Big Data can be challenging and expensive both in terms of cost and time. Analytical solutions need to keep adapting themselves to keep up with the challenge of exponential data growth rate.
 Apache CarbonData is a unified storage solution + File Format which aims to optimize the query performance thus decreasing the analytical cost. Apache CarbonData has been adapted by 100+ open source users. In databases, one of the major features is indexes, which basically helps to query without having to scan every row. Taking inspiration from the same concept Apache CarbonData supports custom indexes like min/max, bloom, Lucene, Secondary Index, and Materialized Views for faster row level updates, deletes, OLAP and point queries.
 This presentation emphasizes on CarbonData’s custom index architecture + Distributed Index Cache Server which helps to provide faster query results, the future challenges and scope.

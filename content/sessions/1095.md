In mid-2018 the Cassandra community committed to making Cassandra 4.0 the most stable major release of Cassandra in the project’s history. In September, the community shifted focus from feature work and development to ensuring the quality of the release. To this end, we have adopted several new approaches to testing and validation including the replaying of production traffic, code audits, and property-based testing. This talk will explore the methodologies we’ve adopted and the results of their application as well as costs of this level of commitment to testing and its benefits.

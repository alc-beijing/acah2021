As the basic software of message communication, message-oriented middleware has been widely used in many IT systems in the industry (such as big data analysis, OpenStack for cloud computing infrastructure, Internet of Things/Internet of vehicles, edge computing applications). In the technological evolution and development direction of message-oriented middleware, mobile cloud has always adhered to the development route of the integration of self-research and open source, and actively embraced the open source ecology on the basis of self-research. Especially in recent years, with the continuous and rapid development of mobile cloud business, the message-oriented middleware cloud product system based on open source technology ecology has been increasingly favored by the market. Since '18, Mobile Cloud has been actively involved in co-building open source communities such as Apache RocketMQ, Apache Pulsar, and Apache Kafka. At present, the mobile cloud messaging middleware team has cultivated more than a number of Apache top project Commiter/PMC members. In this Talk, we will introduce the development of open source messaging middleware in mobile cloud in the past few years, business exploration and practice, and future planning.

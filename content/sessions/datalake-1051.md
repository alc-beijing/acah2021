With the integration of cloud computing and big data technology, cloud-native lake warehouse has gradually become a hot spot in the industry. Kubernetes and Apache Spark, as open source technology leaders in cloud native and big data, combine to become the first choice of many people. However, using Spark as a lake analysis engine on Kubernetes faces many challenges, such as resource management, task scheduling, storage interconnection, elastic scalability, and high reliability. Kyligence has accumulated a wealth of experience in serving a variety of clients, and actively participates in and gives back to the community; This talk will share how to build a cloud-native lake analytics engine out of the box based on a range of open source technologies such as K8S, Spark, Gluten, Volcano, Kyuubi, and more.

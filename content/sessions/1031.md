As distributed applications grow more complex, dynamic, and massively scalable, “observability” becomes more critical. Observability is the practice of using metrics, monitoring and distributed tracing to understand how a system works. In this presentation we’ll explore two complementary Open Source technologies: Prometheus for monitoring application metrics; and OpenTracing and Jaeger for distributed tracing. We’ll discover how they improve the observability of a massively scalable Anomaly Detection system - an application which is built around Apache Cassandra and Apache Kafka for the data layers, and dynamically deployed and scaled on Kubernetes, a container orchestration technology. We will give an overview of Prometheus and OpenTracing/Jaeger, explain how the application is instrumented, and describe how Prometheus and OpenTracing are deployed and configured in a production environment running Kubernetes, to dynamically monitor the application at scale. We conclude by exploring the benefits of monitoring and tracing technologies for understanding, debugging and tuning complex dynamic distributed systems built on Kafka, Cassandra and Kubernetes.

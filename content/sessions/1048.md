Graal's native image generation has been the focus of a lot of attention recently, despite being in the very early stages. This session will look at the Tomcat embedded packaging, how to handle your webapp, and will demo use of Graal and Tomcat in a container environment. The session will mostly be tutorial/demo oriented, after a brief overview of the concept and tools used.

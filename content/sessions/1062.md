Apache StreamPipes (incubating) is an industrial IoT toolbox which enables non-technical users to flexibly connect, analyze and exploit continuous data streams. Under the hood, StreamPipes integrates an event-driven microservice architecture with a rich graphical user interface that lets users create stream processing pipelines. In this talk, we focus on analyzing image data from industrial cameras with Machine Learning (ML) and Apache StreamPipes. Based on an application example for Visual Quality Inspection, techniques for integrating ML models into StreamPipes are presented and a demo shows how product defects can be easily recognized in real time using a no-code approach.
 The talk gives an overview of Apache StreamPipes, highlights the positioning of StreamPipes within the ASF IoT ecosystem and demonstrates how machine learning models can be easily integrated and evaluated within a StreamPipes application.

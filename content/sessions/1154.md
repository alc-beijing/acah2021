The growth of distributed application architecture hits a brick wall when  only using synchronous APIs for integration due to fragility and scalability  limitations. Application development and delivery (AD&D) professionals  need an additional tool in their toolbox to ensure success in their  modernization efforts. This report explains how to best employ event driven architecture (EDA) to address the complexities of modern distributed application architecture.
Various patterns of EDA have emerged: event notification, event-carried state transfer, and event  sourcing. AD&D pros implementing EDA need to understand their trade-offs and select the correct one  for their needs. An additional pattern, called event mesh, ties it all together.
EventMesh is a dynamic cloud-native eventing infrastruture used to decouple the application and backend middleware layer, which supports a wide range of use cases that encompass complex multi-cloud, widely distributed topologies using diverse technology stacks.

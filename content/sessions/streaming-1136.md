The big data real-time computing platform supports event-based low-latency processing and stream-batch integrated data processing, supporting real-time business for 30+ internal and external organizations and 10,000+ data service subscriptions. It processes 2.3 trillion data records and over 600TB of data every day, with a cluster scale of 480+ servers dedicated to supporting more than ten business production product lines.

Based on Apache StreamPark, a one-stop platform for real-time computing job management supports the management of 500+ Flink ON YARN real-time computing jobs in the production environment. Through a visual and concise operation process, it completes project management, job management, team management, permission management, alarm management, log management, version management, cluster management, resource configuration, Flink JAR, Flink SQL, monitoring dashboard, and other management functions, realizing end-to-end real-time job management. This helps teams solve operational and maintenance issues, improve management efficiency, reduce failure rates, and improve business support quality, and fully realizes the integration and platformization of real-time computing management.

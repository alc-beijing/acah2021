We have a [slides template](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1LBeMQqdExuIq7EwO4wWQlptwvHQRXiDl/edit#slide=id.p1). 

**We strongly recommend you to use the template, but if you donâ€™t plan to use it for your entire presentation, please use the title slide at least.**

- If you use your own template, please set your slide size ratio as 16:9.
- Do not include any offensive or sexualized references. This would be a violation of the Code of Conduct.

**Talks are 30 minutes long. This time is inclusive of Q&A.**

The ideal time structure of your presentation would be
- 23-27 minutes presentation.
- 3-5 min Q&A.
